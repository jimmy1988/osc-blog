Our Active IQ fitness tutor, Sam Deeley, recently gave us his top tips to shed the pounds and get back in shape for the Spring</em>\n\n<h2>Take the Stairs</h2>\n\nA simple tip is to avoid those elevators! Statistics show that by using the stairs you burn 7 times more calories than taking the lift.\n\n<h2>Decrease your carbohydrate intake at night</h2>\n\nAt night you will not need to refuel your body, as you will be inactive. Therefore by cutting down your carbohydrate intake it will store less body fat.\n\n<h2>Eat those all-important Vegetables</h2>\n\nBy eating more vegetables, it will help you stay fuller for longer. This means snacking won?t be necessary. The best vegetables to eat include: Kale, Spinach and Broccoli.\n\n<h2>Don?t skip meals</h2>\n\nSkipping your meals will result in you eating more later on, as you?ll be hungrier. You should aim at eating six small meals a day.  Also always remember to have a healthy breakfast, as you will be less likely to snack before lunch. Kick start your metabolism for the day!\n\n<h2>Do your maths </h2>\nIf you do your maths you could lose 1-2 lbs a week. You should aim at being in a 500-calorie deficit every day. For example: You may choose to eat 250 calories fewer than your recommended amount and then do a workout which burns another 250 calories. Just doing 30 minutes of exercise a day, can result in 100 calories being burned. That?s better than no calories!\n\n<h2>Hit the weights</h2>\n\nMuscle at rest burns more calories than fat at rest. Increasing your muscle mass helps you lose weight more efficiently. The more muscle you have, the more fat you will burn.\n\n<h2>Drink more water</h2>\nPut down all of those drinks which are full of calories such as milk, juices and soft drinks. Water has no calories, so drink more of the good stuff!\n\n<h2>Simple Swaps</h2>\n\nSwap those extra-large whole milk lattes or cappuccinos that are full of calories, for a regular size coffee with lower fat milk with fewer calories. It will also save you money! By swapping a big dinner plate to a smaller one, will mean eating a smaller portion. In addition it will look like you have more food on your plate too, bonus!\n<h2>Don?t be greedy</h2>\nOnce you have eaten your food, don?t go back for seconds. Feel satisfied not stuffed!\n\n<h2>Avoid the TV</h2>\nWhen eating in front of the TV we eat more without noticing or even enjoying it.

Here are 10 tips on how to proofread.\n\n<h2>Come back to it</h2>\nIf you have time, leave your finished work for a few hours then come back to it and proofread it with fresh eyes. You are more likely to find those hidden mistakes.\n<h2>Break down what you are looking for</h2>\nYou should read through your report continuously and check your work for one problem at a time. Look and concentrate on the following: sentence structures, word choices, spelling and punctuation.\n<h2>Make sure information is accurate</h2>\nYou should double check all facts, figures and names, to make sure all of your information is correct.\n<h2>Use a spell checker</h2>\nA spell checker is great for finding repeated words, reversed letters, and many other common errors.\n<h2>Trust the dictionary</h2>\nA spell checker can only determine whether a word is a word. It will not tell you whether the meaning of the word is correct. For example fair and fare sound the same but have different meanings. Therefore check the spellings and meanings with a dictionary.\n<h2>Read your work backwards</h2>\nReading your work backwards (from right to left) enables you to spot spelling mistakes easier. This will help you focus on single words instead of sentences.\n<h2>Create a proofreading common mistake checklist</h2>\nMake a checklist of all the mistakes you commonly make. You can then refer back to your list each time you proofread.\n<h2>Ask someone to read your work</h2>\nAllow someone to read your work in order to catch any missed errors. Another set of eyes looking at your work may immediately be able to spot errors that you\'ve overlooked.\n<h2>Proofread using a hard copy</h2>\nPrint out your work and review it one line at a time. By reading your work on a printed version will help you find mistakes that you have previously missed.\n<h2>Read your work aloud</h2>\nBy you or someone you know reading your work aloud; you may hear a problem that you haven?t come across.

There are distractions everywhere- phones, tablets, TV, Netflix.  We\'ve never had so much opportunity to procrastinate. So here are a few tips to help you stay focused on studying and get the most out of your learning.\n\n\n<h2>Organise your space</h2>\n\nBy studying in a tidy environment you are more likely to concentrate, focus on your studies, and get it done. You should remove anything that can distract you and only have your study materials on the desk. Aim to spend 10 minutes cleaning at the end of every day, to help you maintain your organised study place. Turn your phone off and hide it in your draw until later, to stop temptation.\n\n<h2>Make a to-do list</h2>\n\nBy making a to-do list at the beginning of every day or week, will allow you to become more focused. You should prioritise your work, starting with the hardest tasks first. This will allow you to spend longer on them. Finish your day with the easier or more manageable tasks, as you will be less motivated. You should also prioritise to meet deadlines, this way you can spread out your workload.\n\n<h2>Manage your study time</h2>\n\nMake sure you allow a reasonable time frame to complete tasks. Write at the side of the to-do list how long the task will take to complete. You will then be able to fit your other commitments in with your schedule. You may also want to break down harder tasks with shorter, easier ones. This will help you stay motivated.\n\n<h2>Give yourself a break from studying</h2>\n\nRemember to give yourself a break. We know that you will have lots to do with your studies, but allow time to relax. For every hour of studying you should give yourself at least a 5-10 minute break. Giving your brain a break, will help you concentrate more when you get back to your studying. To remind yourself to have a break set a timer to go off every hour of studying.

You can dedicate certain days and times for studying around all of your other commitments.  Determination and self-discipline will be needed to achieve success.\n<h2>Create a table with your current activities</h2>\nMake a one week time table and note:\n<ul>\n	<li>The daily activities you partake in</li>\n	<li>When you are at work/school</li>\n	<li>When you are at home and with family</li>\n	<li>When you eat and sleep</li>\n</ul>\nOnce you have done this, look for times you can dedicate your time to studying. These days and times may be consistent throughout every week.\n<h2>Develop a schedule</h2>\nFrom your current timetable, make a mark in your planner and calendar of all the available days and times devoted to studying. Make sure you block out your studying times on your calendar. You should do this by making it visible and bold, so you don?t forget it. You should also add the subject you are studying, in case you have more than one course to study. This will help you devote enough time to each.\n<h2>Determine your study goals</h2>\nCreate goals at the beginning of each week. For example: what you plan to accomplish and why? Once you have decided on your study goals, you will need to transfer your goals into your study plan. For example what you will be working on when studying.\n<h2>Stick to your schedule</h2>\nAlthough having no strict deadlines is one of the numerous benefits of home learning, you should still stick to your schedule. Even if it is just a rough estimate of when you want to finish your assignments. You will feel a lot better by spreading your work load out throughout the duration of your course. Therefore you will not be rushing to finish it at the end.\n<h2>Balance your schedule</h2>\nBy achieving a balanced schedule and making time for other activities, you will be more refreshed and devoted to studying when you come back to it. Make sure you give yourself some breaks or you will get discouraged and will be tempted to give up.\n\n<h2>When you make a study plan - you\'ll give yourself a better chance of success</h2>\n\nIncreasing numbers of students are attracted to distance learning but unless you have the discipline to keep working through your course it\'s unlikely you\'ll achieve what you want to achieve.

Wondering why you have spent hours on studying and nothing has gone in. Well here are 10 tips on how to take notes from study material effectively.\n<h2>Write Down Key Information</h2>\nWhen taking notes write down the main points by using keywords. Try and put it in your own words, as this will be easier to read later on. Writing the information in your own words will also help you understand what it means and will help you memorise it better.\n<h2>The Cornell System</h2>\nThis system was designed in the 1950?s. With this method you divide your page into 3 sections. The main part of the page is for general notes and a side bar for including key points. The footer at the bottom of the page is for summarising. By using this method, it prevents you from forgetting, encourages concentration and records the main points.\n<h2>Mind Mapping</h2>\nMind mapping allows you to point out all of the main factors on one piece of paper. All of the information is then broken down into a way that is ready to read and understand. As it is somewhat a creative activity, you are less likely to forget information. It is said that by engaging both left and right sides of the brain, your learning will improve.\n<h2>Marking Your Text</h2>\nMark important information such as keywords and figures by highlighting, underlining or circling them. When looking back over the text, these will then stand out.\n<h2>Make a List</h2>\nIt is a good idea to make a list of all of the key definitions and important information. This way you will have them all together instead of keep flicking back through your materials trying to find the relevant information.\n<h2>Keep a List of Questions</h2>\nWhilst reading your learning material, note down anything you don?t understand on a separate piece of paper. You can then go back to your list and research things you?re not sure of or ask your tutor.\n<h2>Use Sticky Notes</h2>\nInsert sticky notes with key points and information on to make them stand out. Using tab sticky notes will also allow you to find relevant information in your book quickly and easily. This will make studying much more time effective.\n<h2>Use Flashcards</h2>\nIndex cards can help you learn by putting summarises of information on one side and a key word on the other. By using this technique you can test yourself on a regular basis, improving your memory.\n<h2>Use diagrams and doodles</h2>\nUsing diagrams and doodles make large amounts of information easier to read and remember. You will be able to relate a doodle to key information, which will make it hard to forget important data.\n<h2>Colour Co-Ordinating</h2>\nUsing colours will help you group and clearly visualise relevant information together.

Also juices such as orange and grapefruit are good for reducing stress and for your immune system too.\n\n<strong>Listen to music</strong>\n\nPutting on some music while you study can help you stay calm and relaxed. It will put you in a better frame of mind and make studying less of a chore.\n\n<strong>Exercise</strong>\n\nOne of the best ways to reduce stress is to exercise. Doing some kind of sport helps your body produce endorphins, which make you feel good. Joining a sports club will also help with stress, especially with regular contact with other people. Even going out for a walk for 30 minutes can help decrease stress levels.\n\n<strong>Meditation</strong>\n\nYou may discard this tip or think it?s not for you, but sitting quietly for 10 minutes can really help with stress. Good breathing techniques allow more oxygen to flow through your bloodstream. This helps you keep calm, relaxed and stress free. Give it a go!\n\n<strong>Take regular breaks</strong>\n\nShort breaks are good for relaxing, but you need to remember longer breaks are important too. Maybe take a weekend off to reward yourself for all of the studying throughout the week. Make sure you include these breaks in your studying. You will then come back to your work feeling refreshed and ready to start again.\n\n<strong>Get a pet</strong>\n\nAmazingly, studies show that spending time with animals is good for our health. Our bodies release hormones that make us feels happy and can lower the amount of stress in our systems. If you haven?t got a pet visit a family or friend that has.\n\n<strong>Sleep</strong>\n\nThe majority of people find that productivity increases when they have 20 minute naps. Make sure you don?t spend all of your time on social media sites and using your electronic devices. This will leave your even more stressed.\n\n<strong>Quit Smoking </strong>\n\nResearch on smoking reveals that nicotine suppresses the hormone serotonin, which fights stress.\n\n<strong>Look at the positive side</strong>\n\nIf you have made a mistake on the last assignment you sent off or you have missed a deadline. It?s not the end of the world. See it as a positive on how you can improve your skills.

For starters a high salary is a big bonus and there is always room to progress. Accountants also receive the following:\n\n<strong>Job security</strong>\n\nAccountants are very important and are a crucial part of running a business. After their studies they are very likely to find a job in their chosen career.\n\n<strong>A clear future</strong>\n\nIf you?re looking for a clear career path with no surprises, accounting may be the perfect choice; your education will provide you with sought-after skills that almost every business needs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics foresees a growth of 13% in accounting and auditing jobs through 2020. It?s definitely not a bad time to be an accountant!\n\n<strong>High salary</strong>\n\nThe average wage of an accountant is £25,000. When you have learnt your trade you can see figures rising to 50,000+. Results show that female accountants are considered having one of the top ten highest salaries.\n\n<strong>Benefits</strong>\n\nThere are many full-time accounting positions that offer benefits. Some of these include: health care, pensions and sometimes the opportunity to become a partner in the business.\n\n<strong>Opportunity for advancement</strong>\n\nSenior accountants may eventually double the wage of an entry level accountant. Accountants are always in demand, so it would be fairly easy to change to work in a different location.\n\n<strong>A great network</strong>\n\nWhen working as an accountant you will develop contacts that can help you learn and improve your skills. You can also refer to these contacts for advice if needed.\n\n<strong>Career diversity</strong>\n\nThere are many different careers that someone who has studied accounting can go in to. Some of these include careers in: finance, auditing, taxation, accounting, business and many more. You can study in a number of sectors for example: a small firm or corporation, the government, the private sector, or you may even start your own company. When learning about finances it will put you in a great position to manage any account.\n\n<strong>Developed Technology</strong>\n\nWith new software and technology, it will make your job a lot easier.

It is best to go into details when creating your character, you may need to consider for example, how they cook dinner or their petty likes and dislikes. Anything small and trivial could leave your audience relating better to your character. The story is only as good as the character within them.\n<h2>Story</h2>\nScreen writing is about telling exciting stories through different characters. The elements of a good story are listed below:\n<ol>\n 	<li>The story is about somebody with whom we have some empathy</li>\n 	<li>They want something very badly</li>\n 	<li>This goal is difficult, but possible to do, get, or achieve</li>\n 	<li>The story accomplishes maximum emotional impact and audience connection</li>\n 	<li>The story comes to a satisfactory ending, which may not necessarily be a happy one.</li>\n</ol>\nThe formula that many screenplay authors use is: (Character + Want) x Obstacles = Story\n\nYou will need to take into consideration the main areas of the story such as location, population and situation. Your aim is to create a well-developed and plausible situation.\n<h2>Structure</h2>\nScreenwriting can be split into two parts. These include: the actual writing and the dramaturgy. The artist when writing does not have any rules to follow, which is why all screenplays are unique in themselves.\n\nDramaturgy is the theoretical, cerebral, rational, and scientific part of the play. The screenwriter uses practical strategies and time-tested models to help develop and design a solid blueprint for the composition of the screenplay.\n<blockquote>?In the first act, it?s who are the people and what is the situation of this whole story. The second act is the progression of that situation to a high point of conflict and great problems. And the third act is how the conflicts and problems are resolved.\" - Ernest Lehman</blockquote>\n<h2>Voice</h2>\nAll good screenwriting have a distinctive voice. A story with the same objectives can be completed with equal quality; however the voice of the script may be very different. The way you describe the action is the core of the play and is the artist?s choice. You will then be able to lead your audience into becoming active participants in the story. The voice of a character is their distinct way of speaking for example: cadence, dialect, accent and vocabulary\n<h2>Form</h2>\nJust creating engaging characters who are struggling to obtain a goal in an amazing memorable world with an original voice, still isn?t enough to write a screenplay. Form needs to be considered and it cannot be ignored. Screenplays must be written in present tense and should include what the audience should see and hear. The three C?s should also be used: clear, concise and creative. When writing a screenplay you only have between 90 and 120 minutes to tell the story ? that?s not a lot of time at all!\n\nIf you would like to write a screenplay or want to find out more then enrol on our <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/screen-script-writing-skills-3.html\">Screen and Script Writing Skills Level 3</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/screen-script-writing-skills-3.html\">Take a look at our Screen and Script Writing Skills Level 3 course &gt;&gt;</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2016-01-19 16:00:02','2017-03-29 13:11:02',2,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/?p=4568',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL);

By the age of 51, 85% of ?mature? students will be homeowners, compared to 75% of typical graduates and 68% of early leavers.\n\nAnd it isn?t a case of last but by no means least with those returning to education set to have a mean property value of just over £500,000 by 51 compared to just under £300,000 at the same age amongst degree holders, based on current house prices.\n\nA total of 1,000 Britons were surveyed to compile the figures, with the results then used to build a General Linear Regression model ? which takes variables from a survey to predict likely outcomes.\n\nDr David Lewis, director of research of Mindlab who delivered the study for Open Study College, said: ?I conducted this research for Open Study College and the findings were quite fascinating.  We expected to find that graduates would have the greatest share of property ownership over the age of 4o, and the smallest under the age of 30, but this was not true.  They were the most likely, by a margin of a few percent, to own a home by the age of 30 - albeit in very small numbers - but began to get left behind as they entered their forties with both the ?unqualified? and ?mature? students ? those we dubbed Newdents ? surpassing them and buying homes, whilst they rented or stayed with parents.?\n\nThe study also found that later learners are more likely to be in a better paid role and to hold director or managerial positions.

Interestingly, this group also holiday less which again suggests that they are sensible with money.\n\n?After abandoning my medical studies while in my early 20s, I spent more than a decade working in the ?real? world before returning to university as a mature student.

This means the first few years after graduating aren?t as productive in terms of earning and life progression as they might be.\n\n?In contrast, many of the people we see returning to study have a clear focus, whether it?s a promotion at work to help them save for a house deposit, or to retrain for a completely new career to increase job satisfaction.\n\n?In my view though, the real differences between the continuous and late studiers, is debt.  The demand for distance and online learning is growing at an incredible pace because it doesn?t cost £30,000 to get a qualification.  The digital age has obviously helped with this ? people are used to shopping and banking online, so why not learn too?

This means the first few years after graduating aren?t as productive in terms of earning and life progression as they might be.\n\n?In contrast, many of the people we see returning to study have a clear focus, whether it?s a promotion at work to help them save for a house deposit, or to retrain for a completely new career to increase job satisfaction.\n\n?In my view though, the real differences between the continuous and late studiers, is debt.  The demand for distance and online learning is growing at an incredible pace because it doesn?t cost £30,000 to get a qualification.  The digital age has obviously helped with this ? people are used to shopping and banking online, so why not learn too?  But above all, it?s cheaper to learn this way ? and, it would seem, more financially beneficial long term.?\n\nFor more information on Open Study College please visit www.openstudycollege.com.\n',NULL,NULL,9,'2016-01-20 15:12:19','2016-01-20 15:12:19',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/2016/01/20/4634-revision-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

Take time to think about your work and whether you\'re happy with what you do. Here 3 different ways to tell if you are in the wrong job:\n\n<h2>Do you seek distractions at work?</h2>\n\nIf you would rather focus your time on distractions than getting your work done, then your job is not important to you. You should be paying attention to your work and enjoying it whilst completing it. If you don?t feel like you can enjoy your work, then you are in the wrong job or need a new project or change.\n\n<h2>Do you have no interest in engaging with your team?</h2>\n\nDo you get along with the people you work with? Maybe you have a personality conflict with them? Or maybe you have no idea why ? but you do not want to join in with discussions. Then you are in the wrong job. You spend the majority of your life at work with the same people, so if you can?t be yourself around them then you will find your job boring and awkward. It is your boss?s duty to make sure all of their staff are working as a team so if you have a problem talk to them!\n\n<h2>Are you doing it just for the money?</h2>\n\nThere is nothing wrong with loving the money you get from your job, but that shouldn\'t be the only reason you like your job. Your job should be in something you have passion for and which allows you to show off your talents. Ask yourself what would you do for the rest of your life for free? If this isn\'t your current job, you need to change your career path. Gaining a new qualification from home can help with this, without giving up you current job.\n\nSo why not take a look at our courses now!',NULL,NULL,9,'2016-01-22 09:23:57','2016-01-22 09:23:57',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/2016/01/22/4379-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

This technique covers all areas of your business so it helps to get yours on track to success.\n\n<strong>Here are the 7p?s:</strong>\n<h2>Product</h2>\nIn order to have a good product you need to find out what customers need and want. It will be a disaster if you develop a product or service and no one wants to buy it. You will have to create the right product with the correct quality to meet your target audience expectations.\n<h2>Price</h2>\nWhat are customers prepared to pay for your product? This price should be competitive, but doesn?t mean you have to be the cheapest in your market. Your product could give people a more personalised service, exclusive add-ons or better value for money. Price is what generates money for your business; therefore you will need to make a profit. All the other elements in the marketing mix represent a cost to you, which means pricing your product or service is very important. It is best to look at price from a customer?s perspective.\n<h2>Place</h2>\nYour product or service should be available:\n<ul>\n	<li>In the right place</li>\n	<li>At the right time</li>\n	<li>In the right quantity</li>\n</ul>\nThe distribution of your product must be appropriate and convenient for your customer to receive it. This is even more important to those products and services sold online, as it is so easy for a customer to go elsewhere.\n<h2>Promotion</h2>\nPromotion allows a business to communicate to its customers. This can be in the form of: branding, advertising, PR, corporate identity, social media outreach, sales management, special offers and exhibitions. These must gain attention and awareness and be appealing. The promotion that you send out must contain a consistent message and give the customer a reason to use your business rather than going elsewhere.\n<h2>People</h2>\nEveryone that comes into contact with your business will make an impression. Many customers comment on both or either the product that you?re offering and the service they have been given. This may have a positive or negative effect on your business and customer satisfaction.\n<h2>Process</h2>\nCustomers don?t just buy a product; they invest in an entire experience. This starts when they discover your company and lasts through the purchase and after stages. If you have an online business you will need to think about, whether your website is fast enough or on the right devices.\n<h2>Physical Evidence</h2>\nWhen customers are unfamiliar about a product or service, they can be indecisive. They will be wary about how good the product will be after the purchase.  Therefore you need to reduce this by helping potential customers ?see? what they are buying. Reassuring your customers will get you more sales.\n\nIf you want to learn more about this important strategy and understand how to market your business then why not study one of our <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/marketing-pr-social-media_courses.html\">marketing courses</a>?\n\n<a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/marketing-pr-social-media_courses.html\">Take a look at our marketing courses now&gt;&gt;</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2016-02-17 11:51:49','2016-02-17 11:51:49',2,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/?p=4782',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

If they did it would have been in the afternoon, during daylight and occasionally at night for an hour at a time. They were woken up to complete their daily chores or to fight. In their free time they played cards and wrote letters.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Trench Environment</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Trenches would have been very muddy and smelly. Dead bodies were located nearby and their toilets sometimes overflowed into the trenches. Millions of rats infested the trenches and lice irritated soldiers. Trench foot was also a big problem. As the trenches flooded, the cold water and mud blackened the foot and caused the death of surface tissue. This was a painful condition for soldiers. November 29, 1915 Diary Entry:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>It has teemed. The trenches are ankle deep ? some places calf deep ? in mud and the communications trenches are rushing streams of brown water. The men are wet through but stick the job like Britons and I hope for their sake that the weather lifts with the morning. The guns have been strafing today, though up till now we have dodged the show. It may be ours again tomorrow though.

This is so you can get all of your ideas on paper before you forget them. Planning your work will also prevent any mishaps. You should start by writing a one-sentence summary, this should summarise your novel and get to the point of what you want it to be about. Break down your plans into chapters and include the main points which will be included in each.\n<h2>Your characters are important</h2>\nCome up with a character that will surprise your audience and take your readers through unexpected directions. Give them a problem and make sure something important happens in every scene. To test if your novel does this summarise in a sentence what happens for each scene. If you can?t see that things are moving forward or if there aren\'t enough twists and turns then change or cut them out.\n<h2>Understand your audience</h2>\nNot everyone will love your book, even if you think it?s a best seller! Understanding your audience will determine a lot of things. For instance the type of tone and storyline you choose.\n\nHow to identify your target audience:\n? Think about what type of people the book would interest?\n? Identify other books like yours and look at their main buyers/readers\n? Pinpoint what is special about your book\n?

The novel will usually end in a large set-piece where the main threat (and demons) throughout the story, such as a German battleship and/or self-doubt, will finally be faced. It?s a pattern that is used by many of his stories but its written so well you don?t really mind.\n\nHis writing style is engaging and rich, the best novelists and novels create a world that is easily imagined as you read it and as you read Reeman?s novels you can easily imagine the terror of the engine room stokers fearing a torpedo crashing through the hull any minute or the cold and tension of the night watch looking out for signs of the enemy before it?s too late. It?s a world I will (hopefully!) never actually live in myself but with these novels I can feel that I?m there.',NULL,NULL,9,'2016-03-03 13:50:18','2016-03-03 13:50:18',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/2016/03/03/4876-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

It is a complex body of knowledge that reveals how to balance the energies of any given space to assure health and good fortune for people inhabiting it. Feng means wind and Shui means water. Wind and water in the Chinese culture are associated with good health. From this, good Feng Shui has come to mean good fortune, whilst bad luck and misfortune is represented by bad Feng Shui. Many people use Feng Shui to help decorate their homes. There are 5 main elements of Feng Shui, these include:\n<h2>Wood</h2>\nWood is the energy of expansion, unlimited growth, abundance, vision, steadiness and survival. It is associated with the colours green and brown and is connected to upward growth, being joyful, happy and grounded at the same time. When a healthy plant or tree has deep roots it can stand tall, reaching out to the sky and sun. This reinforces the balance between grounding and giving an uplifting energy.\n<h2>Fire</h2>\nFire is the energy of the bright sun, happy celebrations, glorious and joyful achievements. It also brings the energy of strong sexual desires, passions and romance. The main colours associated with the fire element are: red, yellow and orange. There is no good Feng Shui without the bright, bold and happy energy of the fire element. Using too little of the fire element in your house will limit the happy energy, too much will increase conflicts and rising tempers.\n<h2>Earth</h2>\nEarth is the energy of nourishment, stability, support and caring patience.

Your dreams may even depend on your grades you receive, which is why you need to start passing those all-important assignments. Here are 5 tips to help you get good grades:\n<h2>Organise your studies</h2>\nAs distance learning allows you to be flexible and has no strict deadlines, you may want to consider setting some targets. To help with this write down in a planner or on a calendar when you wish to complete your assignments by. You will then know how long you can spend on each one and it will allow you measure your progress.

You will also need to discover whether you work better in the day or at night. Are you are an early bird or a night owl? You will not achieve the best grade without doing your own additional research. Reading up into more depth about a certain subject will allow you to expand on your knowledge.\n<h2>Ask your tutor for help</h2>\nDo not hesitate to ask your tutor if you are unsure on anything. Even if you think the answer is obvious or you think its ?silly?, they want to help you get the best out of your learning so ask away! When reading your course materials or your text book if there is anything you are having trouble understanding write it down on a piece of paper, so you can then ask your tutor.\n<h2>Choose the right subject</h2>\nTake your time deciding which course to enrol onto. If the topic is about something you don?t enjoy you will not be interested in it and it will be very difficult to get good grades. If you are interested in the subject you are more likely to do well, as you will want to do further reading and expand on your knowledge. You will be more motivated and determined to succeed.\n<h2>Prioritise your study time</h2>\nIf you want to achieve a good grade in your course, you should prioritise your study time.

Make sure you organise your work and your place of study, so you do not have any distractions whilst learning.\n<h2>Prioritise</h2>\nDon?t spend hours on a task that doesn\'t need to be completed any time soon. Start with more important tasks that have deadlines approaching. By prioritising your work  it will allow you to get the assignments that have shorter deadlines completed first. This will prevent you from falling behind and rushing your work at the end of your course.\n<h2>Reduce Interruptions</h2>\nStop and stay away from any interruptions whilst you study. Put your phone in your draw, even if social media is calling you! Tell the people you live with that you are studying and not to interrupt you. They will understand that you need to concentrate. Finding a quiet place to study will also help you to focus on your work.\n<h2>Don?t forget to have a break</h2>\nYou should aim to have a 5-10 minute break after every hour of studying. This break will allow your brain to rest before going back to your work. You should also remember to have a couple of days off from studying a week. Whatever you plan to do whether it?s meeting friends or even spending the day watching TV make sure you relax and enjoy yourself, so that you are ready to begin studying again.\n<h2>Get a good night\'s sleep</h2>\nYou should aim at getting 6-9 hours sleep at night.

Not just on the enjoyment that a great story can bring, but on other benefits too.

The more you read increases your knowledge and enables you to be better-equipped to tackle any challenge. Remember knowledge is power!\n<h2>Vocabulary Expansion</h2>\nThe more you read the more words you are exposed to. Inevitably this will then make its way into your everyday vocabulary. This will help in any profession, as you will be able to speak to those higher than you with confidence. It could even help in developing your career path, as those that are well-spoken, well-read and knowledgeable tend to get promotions sooner then those that don\'t.\n<h2>Memory Improvement</h2>\nYour brain has to remember a lot of things when reading a book.

A well-written novel can transport you into other worlds and allow tensions to drain away allowing you to relax.\n\n<strong>Knowledge </strong>\n\nEverything you read provides your head with new information. The more you read increases your knowledge and enables you to be better-equipped to tackle any challenge. Remember knowledge is power!\n\n<strong>Vocabulary Expansion</strong>\n\nThe more you read the more words you are exposed to. Inevitably this will then make its way into your everyday vocabulary. This will help in any profession, as you will be able to speak to those higher than you with confidence. It could even help in developing your career path, as those that are well-spoken, well-read and knowledgeable tend to get promotions more quickly.\n\n<strong>Memory Improvement</strong>\n\nYour brain has to remember a lot of things when reading a book.

It isn\'t enough to say \'I\'ve watched movies all my entire life.\'\"\n\n<cite>- Stephen King</cite></blockquote>\nHow often have you watched a movie and thought \'I can do better than that\'? Well maybe you can, but writing a screenplay or TV script is a very different discipline to writing a novel and it comes with its own set of rules.\n\nEven a bestselling author who captivates readers all over the world had difficulty writing a screenplay and had to learn how to adapt his approach.\n\nSo what are the key differences?\n<h2>Length</h2>\nA 120 page script is 2 hours of film.  If you\'re used to writing novels and short stories then you\'re accustomed to having space to build backstory, create characters, and weave worlds. But in this format you don\'t have that space. Turning 400 pages of prose into a 120 page script is tough.\n\n<h2>Voice</h2>\nYou\'re telling the story through dialogue and most novelists aren\'t used to that (although Gregory Macdonald\'s Fletch novels are filled with dialogue and probably wouldn\'t be too hard to adapt into a screenplay).\n\nNovelists are used to showing exactly what the lead character is thinking and feeling. The obvious way to translate this to the screen would be to use narration but you don\'t tend to find it used much in scripts. Why? In most cases, it\'s dull.  Long monologues are going to bore the audience. Unless you can find a genuinely compelling reason to include lots of narration (and are lucky enough to have Morgan Freeman voicing it), it\'s probably best avoided.\n<h2>Action</h2>\n\'Murder your darlings\' is sound advice for novelists but ruthless editing is essential when writing a screenplay. Huge chunks of descriptive prose are thrown out of the window because the detail and visuals need to be boiled down to a short and snappy summary, and a location.\n\n<h2>Budget considerations</h2>\nAre you serious about selling your script?\n\nIf you\'re writing a novel, then you can craft that fantasy epic you\'ve been dreaming about for years.\n\nBut dragons, trolls, and other special effects cost money. And nobody is eager to open a chequebook and invest £150 million in a film by a first time screen writer.\n\nWriter/Director Kevin Smith\'s first movie, Clerks, was self-financed so keeping the budget down would have been vital. He set in the New Jersey convenience store that he worked at, shot it in black and white, and cast a lot of his friends. But that still cost $27000.\n\nAsk yourself: How many characters are in the story? How many locations do we need? Be prepared to scale things down to a smaller budget if you want to maximise your chances of selling your first screenplay.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/screen-script-writing-skills-3.html\">Want to know more about writing screenplays and scripts?

It not only allows your business to succeed, but it also helps in developing and improving your employees\' skills. Here are 5 tips on how to manage employee performance effectively:\n<h2>Setting clear goals</h2>\nYour employees need to know what is expected of them. You can?t just assume they know, as they won\'t be able to perform to the required standard. Make sure you set clear goals so they know exactly what needs to be done in order to meet deadlines. Check employees understanding and challenge any assumptions.\n<h2>Treat people as individuals</h2>\nEveryone works and responds differently to various tasks. When managing performance, you will need to know what works well with people and what doesn\'t. You will then get the best out of everyone, whilst improving rapports and performance.\n<h2>Giving regular feedback</h2>\nDon?t wait until the next review or annual appraisal, discuss employees performance informally on a regular basis and then use formal meetings to merely confirm and record what has been said throughout the year. Therefore if there are any problems, these can be noticed quicker and be sorted faster in order to improve performance.\n<h2>Focus on the positive</h2>\nMaximise positive reinforcement and praise employees for their hard work. Show employees that you appreciate their hard work and make them understand that the business could not function without them. Although, this does not mean that you should ignore the negative aspects of their performance. You should always try to find ways to improve.\n<h2>Support and develop</h2>\nA good manager supports their employees in achieving their full potential.

Here are 5 tips on how you can do just that:\n<h2>Setting clear goals</h2>\nYour employees need to know what is expected of them. You can?t just assume they know, as they will not be able to perform to the required standard. Make sure clear goals are set so they know exactly what needs to be done and when to meet deadlines. Check employees understanding and challenge any assumptions.\n<h2>Treat people as individuals</h2>\nEveryone works and responds differently to various tasks. When managing performance, you will need to know what works well with people and what doesn?t. This will then get the best out of everyone, whilst improving rapports and performance.\n<h2>Giving regular feedback</h2>\nDon?t wait till the next review or annual appraisal, discuss employees performance informally on a regular basis and then use formal meetings to merely confirm and record what has been said throughout the year. Therefore if there are any problems, these can be noticed quicker and be sorted faster in order to improve performance.\n<h2>Focus on the positive</h2>\nMaximise positive reinforcement and praise employees for their hard work. Show employees that they have a self of belonging to the business and it could not function without them. Although this does not mean that you should ignore the negative aspects of their performance, you should always try to find ways to improve.\n<h2>Support and develop</h2>\nA good manager supports their employees in achieving their full potential. This support comes in the form of training, coaching, mentoring and much more. If an employee is failing you should always create a plan of action to address the issue.\n\nAre you interested in managing employee performance?\n\nMaybe you want to improve your business?\n\nOr gain the skills needed to help you become better at your job?\n\nThen enrol on our distance learning course today!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/managing-employee-performance-2.html\">Take a look at our Managing Employee Performance Level 2 Course&gt;&gt;</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2016-05-09 12:27:58','2016-05-09 12:27:58',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/2016/05/09/5271-revision-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

This shows that stress in the workplace is becoming increasingly common, which is why it is important for us to understand how to control it. Take a look at these 5 tips to help you do just that:\n<h2>Organisation</h2>\nA study reveals that having a messy work environment can raise stress and anxiety levels. Before you start working you should take a few minutes to tidy up your desk - and remove that day old coffee! Open a window and let some fresh air in - you don?t want to be working in a stuffy room. Try and plan your day. Work out what order you will complete your tasks, when you will take your break and fit in any meetings you may have throughout the day. You are then ready for anything!\n<h2>Step outside</h2>\nOn your break try and take a stroll outside, this will allow your brain to rest before getting back to your work. If you work by a local park why not take a walk there and enjoy the fresh air!\n<h2>Tune into distractions</h2>\nAre you someone that tries to block out the constant tapping on the desk by the colleague next to you or the conversation that?s happening two desks over? Well this may cause you to become even more stressed. Mindfulness experts have argued that trying to block it out causes more harm than good and instead we should tune into the distraction and become aware of it. This helps our body to relax.\n<h2>Talk to someone</h2>\nIf you?re having a difficult day at work talk it out. Chatting to a friend or close relative can help lower stress levels and also allow you to see situations from different perspectives.\n<h2>Positive outlook on stress</h2>\nStress is not as bad as you may think, it all depends on how you look at it. An experiment was conducted and results showed that those who had been exposed to positive information about stress improved their psychological symptoms and displayed a better work performance. So adopting a more positive attitude towards stress can help us deal with it more efficiently.\n\nIf you would like to know more, then enrol on our <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/stress-management-3.html\">Stress Management in the Workplace Level 3 Course.</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/stress-management-3.html\">Take a look at our Stress Management in the Workplace Level 3 Course &gt;&gt;</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2016-05-27 10:45:58','2016-05-27 10:48:58',2,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/?p=5309',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

This will also open up opportunities for you to travel to foreign countries during your career.

The positive effects include memory improvement, longer attention span, and a reduced risk of age-related cognitive decline.\n<h2>Establishing connections and friendships</h2>\nHave you ever wanted to understand what someone is saying when they are talking in a different language?  Has this ever happened to you?

This shows that stress in the workplace is becoming increasingly common, which is why it is important for us to understand how to control it. Take a look at these 5 tips to help you do just that:\n<h2>Organisation</h2>\nA study reveals that having a messy work environment can raise stress and anxiety levels. Before you start working you should take a few minutes to tidy up your desk - and remove that day old coffee! Open a window and let some fresh air in - you don?t want to be working in a stuffy room. Try and plan your day. Work out what order you will complete your tasks, when you will take your break and fit in any meetings you may have throughout the day. You are then ready for anything!\n<h2>Step outside</h2>\nOn your break try and take a stroll outside, this will allow your brain to rest before getting back to your work. If you work by a local park why not take a walk there and enjoy the fresh air!\n<h2>Tune into distractions</h2>\nAre you someone that tries to block out the constant tapping on the desk by the colleague next to you or the conversation that?s happening two desks over? Well this may cause you to become even more stressed. Mindfulness experts have argued that trying to block it out causes more harm than good and instead we should tune into the distraction and become aware of it. This helps our body to relax.\n<h2>Talk to someone</h2>\nIf you?re having a difficult day at work talk it out. Chatting to a friend or close relative can help lower stress levels and also allow you to see situations from different perspectives.\n<h2>Positive outlook on stress</h2>\nStress is not as bad as you may think, it all depends on how you look at it. An experiment was conducted and results showed that those who had been exposed to positive information about stress improved their psychological symptoms and displayed a better work performance. So adopting a more positive attitude towards stress can help us deal with it more efficiently.\n\nIf you would like to know more, then enrol on our <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/stress-management-3.html\">Stress Management in the Workplace Level 3 Course.</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/stress-management-3.html\">Take a look at our Stress Management in the Workplace Level 3 Course &gt;&gt;</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2016-05-27 11:45:47','2016-05-27 11:45:47',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/2016/05/27/5309-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

You should try and summarise a page of text into 5 bullet points, this will prove you have actually understood the information.

This will give you the basis of the perfect job for you. Your career should be based on something that you enjoy doing and what you are good at.

By doing this you will be able to recognise what works best with your abilities.\n<h2>Build you own job post</h2>\nWrite down on paper what your ideal job would be. Give details about what the job would entail, your responsibilities, the company you would love to work for and don?t forget to state where you would like it to be located.

	(444,'The truth about common nutrition myths','the-truth-about-common-nutrition-myths',NULL,NULL,'In a world full of vegans, flexitarians and fitness fanatics having a healthy diet and good nutrition is a key component to our lives.\n\nThere are so many theories and myths about what is good for us, what isn\'t, what we should be eating, and how we should live our lives. People seem to think they know what?s good for us, which is all well and good, but are there any facts to prove it? In addition, each person is different so what may be good for the few might not be for the many.\n\nTo help put you at ease, here are the top 5 most common nutrition approaches and the truth behind the myth...\n<h2>Drinking fruit juice</h2>\nFruit juices contain more sugar than people may like to admit. Yes, it may be natural sugars if you buy natural and not from concentrate, but the majority are made from water and sugar with added chemicals for preservation and taste. Some can even contain the same amount of sugar that is included in Coca Cola and Pepsi!\n\nSwap your fruit juice for water and eat real fruit instead. This will do much more for your body and health than fruit juices.\n<h2>Eating \'Superfoods\'</h2>\nWhen looking for food products you should always check the label. Although foods may be branded as a superfood, it doesn\'t mean that they don\'t contain any calories or that they are the best choice. For  example, did you know that 50g of dried goji berries (a supposed superfood) contain 155 calories? But did you also know that 100g of strawberries contain 30 calories? Double the portion and less than half of the calories. Always read the label and don\'t just trust what you are told.\n<h2>Whole Wheat</h2>\nWhole wheat has a lot of nutritional benefits. It contains more fiber than white carbohydrates which regulates your digestive system and helps to keep you fuller for longer. BUT, it still contains a lot of calories and carbohydrates; eating too much of this will still result in weight gain and can increase cholesterol.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Just counting your calories</h2>\nAlthough our calorie intake is important to us, you shouldn\'t focus on this solely. You should also pay attention to choosing the right food to eat and making your body want to lose weight. By eating less sugar and carbohydrates with more protein and fat can help you to lose weight without even counting a single calorie.\n\nPortion Size\n\nSmaller portions does not always equal less calories. You could have a single McDonald\'s Big Mac Burger but this wouldn\'t be healthier than a large plate of chicken salad. Nor would it have as few calories. Think about what food you eat more than how much you eat, as better foods will also do a better job of keeping you full and healthy.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about our diet and nutrition why not enrol on our <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/ncfe-nutrition-consultant.html?dc=4\">Level 3 Nutrition Consultant</a> course today!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/ncfe-nutrition-consultant.html?dc=4\">Take a look at our Nutrition Consultant Level 3 course &gt;&gt;</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2016-06-30 11:57:46','2018-10-10 12:49:26',2,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/?p=5494',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

Here are the top 5 most common nutrition approaches that can actually do us more harm than good.\n<h2>Drinking fruit juice</h2>\nIf you think you are being good and only drinking fruit juices, you are making a huge mistake. Most fruit juices don?t even contain fruit at all. The majority are made from water and sugar with chemicals that just taste like fruit. Even if you drink the juices with 100% fruit added, this is still a bad idea. They can contain the same amount of sugar that is included in Coca Cola and Pepsi! So you are best just eating while fruits instead.\n<h2>Purchasing ?healthy? products</h2>\nWhen looking for food products you should always check the label. Many companies may add the slightest amount of healthy ingredients and advertise it as a healthy option when most of it is processed junk food. For example, tiny amounts of Omega-3\'s are not going to make up for the fact that a food contains large amounts of sugar. You should always read the label!\n<h2>Whole Wheat</h2>\nLots of whole wheat can have a very harmful effect on our bodies. It may even lead to serious diseases including schizophrenia, autism and cerebellar ataxia. Statistics have also shown an increase in cholesterol for people that eat whole wheat. So cut down on your bread intake!\n<h2>Eating processed foods</h2>\nYou should stay away from processed foods and focus on creating your meals from scratch using fresh ingredients. You will then know what has exactly gone into your meal. This way you control your sugar and salt intake. If it looks like it has been made in a factory, keep clear!\n<h2>Just counting your calories</h2>\nAlthough our calorie intake is important to us, you shouldn\'t focus on this solely. Whilst maintaining a healthy calorie intake you should also pay attention to choosing the right food to eat and making your body want to lose weight. By eating less sugar and carbohydrates with more protein and fat can help you to lose weight without even counting a single calorie.\n\nIf you would like to know more about our diet and nutrition why not enrol on our <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/ncfe-nutrition-consultant.html?dc=4\">Level 3 Nutrition Consultant</a> course today!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/ncfe-nutrition-consultant.html?dc=4\">Take a look at our Nutrition Consultant Level 3 course &gt;&gt;</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2016-06-09 11:57:18','2016-06-09 11:57:18',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/2016/06/09/5494-revision-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

Then here are 10 simple studying strategies you need to know:\n<h2>Mind Mapping</h2>\nMind mapping allows you to point out all of the main factors on one piece of paper. All of the information is then broken down into a way that is ready to read and understand. As it is somewhat a creative activity, you are less likely to forget information. It is said that by engaging both left and right sides of the brain, your learning will improve.\n<h2>Marking Your Text</h2>\nMark important information such as keywords and figures by highlighting, underlining or circling them. When looking back over the text, these will then stand out.\n<h2>Make a List</h2>\nIt is a good idea to make a list of all of the key definitions and important information. This way you will have them all together instead of keep flicking back through your materials trying to find the relevant information.\n<h2>Keep a List of Questions</h2>\nWhilst reading your learning material, note down anything you don?t understand on a separate piece of paper. You can then go back to your list and research things you?re not sure of or ask your tutor.\n<h2>Use Sticky Notes</h2>\nInsert sticky notes with key points and information on to make them stand out. Using tab sticky notes will also allow you to find relevant information in your book quickly and easily. This will make studying much more time effective.\n<h2>Use diagrams and doodles</h2>\nUsing diagrams and doodles make large amounts of information easier to read and remember. You will be able to relate a doodle to key information, which will make it hard to forget important data.\n<h2>Colour Co-Ordinating</h2>\nUsing colours will help you group and clearly visualise relevant information together. This will be easier when looking back over your notes.\n<h2>Write Down Key Information</h2>\nWhen taking notes write down the main points by using keywords. Try and put it in your own words, as this will be easier to read later on. Writing the information in your own words will also help you understand what it means and will help you memorise it better.\n<h2>The Cornell System</h2>\nThis system was designed in the 1950?s. With this method you divide your page into 3 sections. The main part of the page is for general notes and a side bar for including key points. The footer at the bottom of the page is for summarising. By using this method, it prevents you from forgetting, encourages concentration and records the main points.\n<h2>Use Flashcards</h2>\nIndex cards can help you learn by putting summarises of information on one side and a key word on the other.

With not having the face-to-face contact with other students and tutors, being self-driven and motivated is key in order for you to succeed. Here are 5 distance learning tips that will help you work your way through your course:\n<h2>Study environment</h2>\nChoose somewhere quiet to study and eliminate any interruptions. Try learning in a library or room in your house and avoid places when you are likely to run into your friends or family!\n<h2>Plan</h2>\nWith no strict deadlines and being able to study at your own pace, you should consider setting your own targets. Noting down in a planner or on a calendar when you wish to complete your assignments will allow you to work out how long you have to complete each assessment and measure your progress.\n<h2>Prioritising</h2>\nDon?t spend hours or even days on a course that doesn?t need to be completed any time soon. Prioritising your work will enable you to finish assignments in a logical order and prevent you from falling behind.\n<h2>Ask for help</h2>\nIf you are unsure on anything do not hesitate to ask your tutor, even if you think the question is silly! Your tutor is there to help you any time of the day by email so ask away. They want you to succeed as much as you!\n<h2>Create study goals regularly</h2>\nYou should aim to come up with new goals at the beginning of each week.

Make sure there are few interruptions when you study. Avoid places where you are likely to run into your friends. Stay concentrated and determined to learn everything you can.\n<h2>Plan</h2>\nAs distance learning allows you to be flexible and has no strict deadlines, you may want to consider targets. To help with this write down in a planner or on a calendar when you wish to complete your assignments. You will then know how long to spend on each one and it will allow you measure your progress. Make sure you organise your work and your place of study, so you do not have any distractions whilst learning.\n<h2>Prioritise your work</h2>\nMake sure you prioritise your work. Don?t spend hours on a task that doesn\'t need to be completed any time soon. Start by more important tasks that have deadlines approaching. By prioritising your work  it will allow you to get the assignments that have shorter deadlines completed first. This will prevent you from falling behind and rushing your work at the end of your course.\n<h2>Ask you tutor for help</h2>\nDo not hesitate to ask your tutor if you are unsure on anything. Even if you think the answer is obvious or you think its ?silly?, they want to help you get the best out of your learning so ask away! When reading your course materials or your text book if there is anything you are having trouble understanding write it down on a piece of paper, so you can then ask your tutor.\n<h2>Determine your study goals</h2>\nCreate goals at the beginning of each week.

Then now is the time to wave goodbye to those days and start winning with those killer moves. Take note of these 5 tips on how to play better chess:\n\n<h2>Try to dominate the centre of the board</h2>\nYou should try and dominate the centre of the board and allow yourself space to develop your important attacking pieces.\n\nA classic first move that you should make is to move the pawn in front of either the king or queen 2 squares forward. This allows you to open up space for your bishops and queen to enter the game. Failing to do this will mean your pawns block you from advancing your important attacking pieces and they won?t be able to play.\n<h2>Move your knights and bishops</h2>\nBefore moving your queen, rooks or king, move your knights and bishops toward the centre of the board. You want to get these pieces out from behind the pawns so they can attack.\n<h2>Think strategically</h2>\nYou need to have your thinking cap on throughout the whole game. Try to understand what your opponents last move did, what they are up to and if they are laying traps to capture your pieces. With this in mind decide on your own plan and always look at all of your possibilities. You should always figure out moves that will threaten your opponent?s king first.\n<h2>Don?t play too fast</h2>\nEven if you see a good move, stop and look. Is there a better move? Patience is the key to playing a great move and can be the difference between you winning or losing the game.  So always double-check your moves and make sure it doesn?t leave anything unprotected.\n<h2>Try looking at the board from your opponents perspective</h2>\nTry flipping the board around and look at the game from your opponents perspective.

Then now is the time to wave goodbye to those days and start winning with those killer moves. Take note of these 5 tips on how you can become a chess champ:\n\n<h2>Learn the moves</h2>\n\nAs every chess piece travels in a certain way, knowing these can help in attacking your opponent. For instance, a pawn moves straight ahead but only attacks on an angle, one square at a time (apart from on the opening move where it can be moved 2 squares forward) So get studying your pieces now!\n\n<h2>Always open with a pawn</h2>\n\nA crucial first move that you should always make is moving the pawn in front of either the king or queen 2 squares forward. This allows you to open ways for your bishops and queen to enter the game. Failing to do this will mean your pawns will be in the way and they won?t be able to play.\n\n<h2>Move your knights and bishops out</h2>\n\nBefore moving your queen, rooks or king, move your knights and bishops toward the centre of the board. You want to get these pieces out from behind the pawns so they can attack.\n\n<h2>Think strategically</h2>\n\nYou need to have your thinking cap on throughout the whole game. Try to understand what your opponents last move did, what they are up to and if they are laying traps to capture your pieces. With this in mind decide on your own plan and always look at all of your possibilities. You should always figure out moves that will threaten your opponent?s king first.\n\n<h2>Don?t play too fast</h2>\n\nEven if you see a good move, stop and look. Is there a better move? Patience is the key to playing a great move and can be the difference between you winning or losing the game.  So always double-check your moves and make sure it doesn?t leave anything unprotected.\n\nAre you ready to take on your new challenge in chess?\n\nMaybe you need that extra boost to strategically think like a professional?\n\nOr perhaps you?ve never played chess before and want to take on a new skill?\n\nThen that?s where our Chess Level 2 course can help you!\n\nTake a look at our Chess Level 2 Course today!',NULL,NULL,9,'2016-07-05 11:06:02','2016-07-05 11:06:02',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/2016/07/05/5649-revision-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

Avoiding these will help improve your learning performance and achieve those higher grades. So if you are guilty of any of these study myths then you need to rethink your studying strategy.\n<h2>?To get good grades I need to spend all my time studying?</h2>\nThis is not true. You need to take a break from studying to enable your brain to relax. You should aim to have a 5-10 minute break after every hour of learning and only study a maximum of 5 days a week, no more! Following this structure will help you on the way to achieving good grades, whilst still having plenty of time left for yourself!\n<h2>?Cramming information is the best way I study?</h2>\nThis method is ineffective. You should never try to cram in information, as this will only be stored into your short term memory and will not be retrained for a long period of time. In order for information to stick into your long term memory, you need to be constantly reminded of it. The best way to do this is to have short studying sessions where you can go over new information that you have learned.

Avoiding these will help improve your learning performance and achieve those higher grades. So if you are guilty of any of these then you need to rethink your studying strategy.\n<h2>?To get good grades I need to spend all my time studying?</h2>\nThis is not true. You need to take a break from studying to enable your brain to relax. You should aim to have a 5-10 minute break after every hour of learning and only study a maximum of 5 days a week, no more! Following this structure will help you on the way to achieving good grades, whilst still having plenty of time left for yourself!\n<h2>?Cramming information is the best way I study?</h2>\nThis method is ineffective. You should never try to cram in information, as this will only be stored into your short term memory and will not be retrained for a long period of time. In order for information to stick into your long term memory, you need to be constantly reminded of it. The best way to do this is to have short studying sessions where you can go over new information that you have learned. This will help you achieve those higher marks without trying to cram everything in one session.\n<h2>?I complete my assignments at the last minute; procrastination does not affect my studying?</h2>\nLeaving your assignments until the night before or completing it on the day it needs to be submitted can have a detrimental effect on your studying skills. It has been found that these types of people are usually the ones to participate in academic dishonesty and plagiarism. In order to avoid leaving your work until the last minute you should start by setting realistic goals, prioritising your studying over free time, making a to-do list and giving yourself deadlines to work from ? getting organised is key!\n<h2>?I can study whilst watching TV?</h2>\nThis is definitely the worst way to study! Watching TV will make you lose focus and distract you from your studies. Sitting there in front of your TV will make it look like you are studying, but actually you are spending most of the time watching what?s on the sceen and potentially spending more time on your studies than is necessary. You should learn in a quiet environment such as a library or a room in your house. Eliminate all distractions, especially your TV! This will help you stay concentrated and be more productive.\n<h2>?I?m the only person with anxiety about exams?</h2>\nMore people than you think have anxiety about their exams. Everyone that cares about their overall grade and mark will have some level of anxiety. If they tell you they don?t then they do not care about their studies at all. Statics show that those who show an optimal level of anxiety in an exam perform better than those that don?t. However try not to be highly stressed as this could have a negative effect on your performance. To make sure you achieve those higher grades you should be prepared for your exam, show up on time, have your supplies ready and get comfortable.

I would suggest bringing along a bag ? you be surprised how many books interest you!\n<h2>Throw your own book themed party</h2>\nIf you want to go all out for National Book Lovers Day why not throw your own party. Have everyone dressed up as a character from their favourite book and serve food featured in some of your favourite books. For example create Wonka chocolate bars from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or make your very own butterbeer from Harry Potter.\n<h2>Spend the day with your book</h2>\nHow does putting on your most comfortable clothes and curling up on the coach with a great book sound?

If you are struggling to study and are wasting your time on strategies that don?t work then you should definitely take note of these 5 effective study techniques:\n<h2>Ask why?</h2>\nAsking why encourages you to learn new information and improves your memory. You should question every new fact you learn in order to gain more details and expand on your knowledge. You can get your answer by asking your tutor or doing your own further research.\n<h2>Self-Explanation</h2>\nTrying to explain what you have learnt will prove that you have understood the information. You should pause from your course materials or reading after a section of text and try to explain what you have just revised. Summarising what you have learnt in 10 bullet points will help with this and make it easier to read back through your notes at a later date.\n<h2>Practice testing</h2>\nPractice testing is a great way to test your memory. This technique improves your learning far more than just reading your course materials and allows you to work your brain by searching your long-term memory. Doing this makes the answer easier to find the next time around. Practice testing can be in the form of flash cards, answering questions from your course materials or mock exams.\n<h2>Distribute your studying</h2>\nStudying a little bit at a time throughout your course duration will help retain information easier as you will constantly be going over it. This then strengthens your memory. Spacing your studying will not only enable you to do better, but you?ll also remember the information you studied for a lot longer.  So stop the late night cramming sessions and start planning!\n<h2>Highlighting</h2>\nHighlighting is a great way to connect important ideas together. It allows us to not just mentally memorise the information, but visually remember it too. The more connections you make the better you will remember. You should use more than one colour when studying in order to create a simple system, but don?t get carried away!

Research has shown that by doing this your error rate goes up by 50% and can take you twice as long to do things. So maybe you should stick to one task at a time!\n<h2>Naps help your brains day to day performance</h2>\nBursts of sleep can really help your brains performance, so good news if you love your sleep! When a memory first gets recorded into the brain it can be easily be forgotten. Napping pushes these memories into the brains long term storage, avoiding them to be replaced.\n<h2>Exercise boosts your brains willpower</h2>\nCompared to those that don?t exercise, those that do have a better long-term memory, attention span and problem-solving skills.  When we exercise we release a protein called Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor which makes us feel at ease and happy.\n<h2>You learn best by teaching others</h2>\nStatistics show that we retain 90% of information when we teach others. This is because we are taking in new information better and remembering the most important parts of what we have learnt. With questions constantly been fired at you these will challenge your understanding of the information.\n<h2>Laughing helps your brain</h2>\nLaughter can actually cause activity in five different areas of the brain. It also leaves your muscles relaxed for approximately 45 minutes after and improves the function of blood vessels.

So take a look at these 5 worst CV mistakes to make sure you don?t ruin your chances of achieving your dream job:\n<h2>Not making it relevant</h2>\nOne of the biggest mistakes you could make when putting together your CV is not targeting it to the job position you are applying for.  Putting in key words that are relevant to the job position will allow your CV to stand out, especially if the employer scans through it. Explain how your skills can help you in that specific industry.\n<h2>Being sloppy</h2>\nSpelling, grammar, sending your CV in the wrong format and including negative information about yourself put recruitment managers off very quickly. These types of CV?s end up in the ?definite no? pile straight away. So make sure you proof read and edit continuously to help produce a perfect CV!\n<h2>Poor formatting</h2>\nA huge turn-off for employers is receiving a CV which isn?t very clear or easy to read. Did you know that on average recruiters spend 8.8 seconds reviewing a CV. So make sure you really sell yourself! With this in mind it is always a good idea to keep your CV brief with only the relevant information included in order for information to be absorbed quickly. You should definitely avoid using too many fonts or sizes and confusing layouts!\n<h2>Lack of evidence</h2>\nFailing to specifically evidence your skills and experiences can be a fatal mistake. Anyone can state that they have a skill, but explaining how they got it can give it a lot more credibility. So make sure you back up information!\n<h2>Too long</h2>\nEmployers do not have the time to read long CV?s, so keep it short! A good CV will consist of two pages ? no more and no less! Slimming down your CV will enable you to show off your communication skills and help you distinguish important information that is specific to the job position.\n\nBoost your CV with a qualification to make you stand out from the crowd!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/contact_us.php\">Contact us </a>to know more about our courses.',NULL,NULL,9,'2016-10-13 11:39:41','2016-10-13 11:39:41',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/2016/10/13/5791-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

Working as a Data Analyst Team Leader while looking after two young children, Julia felt that she was being pulled in all directions.\n\nAfter the birth of her second child Julia knew things had to change. Although she?d been there 12 years, her job was no longer fulfilling her. Her youngest child was in nursery, and neither of them were happy.\n<h3>Time for a change</h3>\nJulia looked at the various aspects of her role as a Data Analyst Team Leader and realised that what she loved was working with numbers. As the saying goes, from small acorns grow big trees. Julia investigated roles including a large amount of numeracy which would also provide the flexibility to work around her children. Then, she looked at which providers would be best suited to deliver the bookkeeping qualifications she needed. After researching all options, Julia chose to study a bookkeeping course with <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/\">Open Study College</a>/ICB. Taking the bull by the horns, she signed up for ICB Levels 2, 3 and 4 Certificates in bookkeeping.\n\nJulia soon found that she enjoyed distance learning as it gave her the flexibility to learn when it suited her. In just one year, Julia had completed levels 2 and 3 with flying colours, achieving distinctions in most of the exams.\n<h3>Next steps</h3>\nJulia went on to work for another bookkeeping business to gain experience whilst in the process of setting up her own bookkeeping business. Then, after less than a year of studies Julia was awarded her own Bookkeeping Practice licence.\n<blockquote>\"As a mum with young children you feel that employment opportunities are limited to either compromising your childcare or stacking shelves.

Bookkeeping Levels 2, 3 and 4\n\nJulia Hill, 36 from Andover, like many other mums in the UK, struggled to juggle a career as a Data Analyst Team Leader with her two beautiful young children.  And, like many other mums, Julia felt that she was being pulled in all directions.\n\nAfter the birth of her second child Julia knew things had to change.  Although she?d been there 12 years, her job was no longer fulfilling her and her young child was in nursery, neither of them were happy.\n\nJulia looked at the aspects of her role as a Data Analyst Team Leader and realised that what she loved was working with numbers.  As they say from small acorns grow big trees.  Julia investigated which roles included a large amount of numeracy and would also provide the flexibility to work around her children.  Then, she looked at which providers would be best suited to deliver the Bookkeeping qualifications she needed.  After researching all options, Julia decided that the Bookkeeping course with Open Study College/ICB.  Taking the bull by the horns, she signed up for ICB Levels 2, 3 and 4 Certificates in Bookkeeping.\n\nBeing out of the learning cycle for some time, Julia soon found that she enjoyed distance learning as it gave her the flexibility to learn when it suited her and before long, in just one year, Julia had completed levels 2 and 3 with flying colours, achieving distinctions in most of the exams.\n\nJulia went on to work for another bookkeeping business to gain experience whilst in the process of setting up her own Bookkeeping business.  Then, after less than a year of studies Julia was awarded her own Bookkeeping Practice licence in June this year.\n<blockquote>\"As a mum with young children you feel that your employment opportunities are limited to either compromising your childcare or stacking shelves.  I decided to be the owner of my own destiny and thanks to the courses through Open Study College and ICB, I am now on the way to having a thriving Bookkeeping business which is rewarding for me and works for our family.\"</blockquote>\nJulia said:\n<blockquote>\"I gained an Institute of Certified Bookkeepers (ICB) qualification through Open Study College and exams with ICB.  I found the course easy to follow with brilliant tutor support and it was a very smooth process.?</blockquote>\nJulia adds:\n<blockquote>?It has not only allowed me to set up my business, my ongoing ICB membership also provides great networking opportunities. With ICB, you don?t just get the qualification then you?re on your own, they provide the support to help you start your own business.  This, together with the recognised ICB accreditation, has helped me network with and secure my first client.\"\n\n\"It?s daunting starting a business, but ICB has given me the tools I needed to open my new practice together with the ongoing support and networking which has been a great help.?</blockquote>\nJulia added:\n<blockquote>\"I am already working with companies to deliver Bookkeeping services and I hope that my business will grow through recommendation of the outstanding service I deliver.\"</blockquote>\nJulia previously worked as a Data Analyst Team Leader, so Bookkeeping is a complete career change. Julia started with Open Study College in July 2015 and passed ICB levels 2 and 3 with a distinction and a merit.  Julia is now all set to complete level 4, Self-Assessment and payroll exams shortly.',NULL,NULL,9,'2017-03-22 09:29:34','2017-03-22 09:29:34',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/2016/11/22/6233-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

They describe fictional characters and events and go into very fine detail.  Why not have a go at creating your own? Here are 5 tips on how to write a successful novel:\n\n<h2>Interesting topic</h2>\nWhat would you want to read the most? Think about what books you lose yourself in. Don?t come up with a story you?re not interested in yourself. Start by listing the types of books you like and that you can?t stop thinking about ? even in your sleep! You will then have your ideal topic your novel should be based on.\n<h2>Planning</h2>\nMake sure you plan your novel before beginning to write it. This is so you can get all of your ideas on paper before you forget them. Planning your work will also prevent any mishaps. You should start by writing a one-sentence summary, this should summarise your novel and get to the point of what you want it to be about. Break down your plans into chapters and include the main points which will be included in each.\n<h2>Your characters are important</h2>\nCome up with a character that will surprise your audience and take your readers through unexpected directions. Give them a problem and make sure something important happens in every scene. To test if your novel does this summarise in a sentence what happens for each scene. If you can?t see that things are moving forward or if there aren\'t enough twists and turns then change or cut them out.\n<h2>Understand your audience</h2>\nNot everyone will love your book, even if you think it?s a best seller! Understanding your audience will determine a lot of things. For instance the type of tone and storyline you choose.\n\nHow to identify your target audience:\n? Think about what type of people the book would interest?\n? Identify other books like yours and look at their main buyers/readers\n? Pinpoint what is special about your book\n? Determine some demographics\n<h2>Stick with it!</h2>\nAs you are writing your novel you will have been tempted to give up thousands of times. As Confucius quotes ?It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop?. You will get better and better and it will be worth it in the end!\n\nIf you want to know more about Fictional Writing why not study our <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/fiction-writing-course.html\">Fiction Writing Level 3 Course.</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/fiction-writing-course.html\">Take a look at our Fiction Writing Level 3 Course now&gt;&gt;</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2017-02-28 13:51:43','2017-02-28 13:51:43',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/4842-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

This was when the obsession started.\n\nThe conversations between me and my family became minimal. I was hooked on a vampire love story and couldn?t get it out my head. I would take the book out everywhere with me. I couldn?t wait for a long car journey so I could read a bit more before I was told to put it down.  I never knew a tension between a vampire and a human could be so strong - something that is so wrong but so right at the same time. Stephenie Meyer told this story so brilliantly, that I simply had to buy the next 3 books and again I was hooked, I had to know more.\n\nEvery page had something new. The controversial twist which led to Bella falling in love with a werewolf left me disheartened. How could she do that to Edward? Stephenie really knew how to shock people. The continuous theme of romance, which was inspired from Shakespeare?s Romeo and Juliet, helped make this series of books so great.

Remember knowledge is power!\n<h2>Vocabulary Expansion</h2>\nThe more you read the more words you are exposed to. Inevitably this will then make its way into your everyday vocabulary.

It could even help in developing your career path, as those that are well-spoken, well-read and knowledgeable tend to get promotions sooner then those that don\'t.\n<h2>Memory Improvement</h2>\nYour brain has to remember a lot of things when reading a book. You have to remember an assortment of characters, their backgrounds, ambitions, history, and nuances, as well as the various arcs and sub-plots that weave their way through every story. Our brains amazingly remember these and therefore help our short-term memory recall as well as stabilising moods.\n<h2>Encourage life?s goals</h2>\nResearch has found that by reading about someone who is overcoming obstacles helps motivate you in meeting your own goals. The more you connect with a character and experience want is happening to them, the more likely you are to take action.\n\n<h2>Stress Reduction</h2>\nIt doesn\'t matter how stressed you are about your studies, work or other commitments; it all just slips away when you lose yourself in a great story.

There are many reasons why it might have been a while since you last studied so here are 5 tips on how to get back into studying:\n<h2>Plan before you start</h2>\nAs it has been a while since you last studied you should start by making a plan to get yourself organised and focused. To help with this write down in a planner or on a calendar when you wish to complete your assignments. You will then know how long to spend on each task and it will allow you measure your progress.\n<h2>Get some sleep</h2>\nOn your time out from studying your sleeping pattern may have changed. You should aim at getting 6-9 hours sleep at night. This will allow your brain to rest and help perform at its peak the following day. Research suggests that sleep plays an important role in memory, both before and after learning a new task. Lack of adequate sleep affects mood, motivation, judgement, and your perception of events. So staying up until 2am hooked on your favourite Netflix series or book needs to be put on hold ? sorry guys!\n<h2>Eliminate distractions</h2>\nStop and stay away from any interruptions whilst you study. Put your phone in your draw, even if social media is calling you! You can use your phone again on your break. Tell the people you live with that you are studying and not to interrupt you. They will understand that you need to concentrate and focus on your work.\n<h2>Create the best study environment</h2>\nStudy somewhere quiet such as in a library or a room in your house. Make sure there are few interruptions when you study. Avoid places where you are likely to run into your friends. Stay concentrated and determined to learn everything you can.\n<h2>Get back into studyin</h2>\nAs soon as your course arrives make sure you get started straight away.

Here are 5 tips to help you get good grades:\n<h2>Organise your studies</h2>\nAs distance learning allows you to be flexible and has no strict deadlines, you may want to consider setting some targets. To help with this write down in a planner or on a calendar when you wish to complete your assignments by. You will then know how long you can spend on each one and it will allow you measure your progress.

You will also need to discover whether you work better in the day or at night. Are you are an early bird or a night owl? You will not achieve the best grade without doing your own additional research. Reading up into more depth about a certain subject will allow you to expand on your knowledge.\n<h2>Ask your tutor for help</h2>\nDo not hesitate to ask your tutor if you are unsure on anything. Even if you think the answer is obvious or you think its ?silly?, they want to help you get the best out of your learning so ask away! When reading your course materials or your text book if there is anything you are having trouble understanding write it down on a piece of paper, so you can then ask your tutor.\n<h2>Choose the right subject</h2>\nTake your time deciding which course to enrol onto. If the topic is about something you don?t enjoy you will not be interested in it and it will be very difficult to get good grades. If you are interested in the subject you are more likely to do well, as you will want to do further reading and expand on your knowledge. You will be more motivated and determined to succeed.\n<h2>Prioritise your study time</h2>\nIf you want to achieve a good grade in your course, you should prioritise your study time.

Learn about human behaviour</h2>\nUnderstanding someone?s behaviour is a great way to explore how the mind works. You will be able to discover how millions of people are affected by disorders of the brain and nervous system including: Alzheimer?s, Parkinson?s disease, strokes and traumatic brain injuries. In addition, find out the answers to fascinating questions such as:\n<ul>\n	<li>Why we feel more energetic in the morning?</li>\n	<li>Why we try to analyse our dreams?</li>\n	<li>How hypnosis works?</li>\n	<li>Why we continuously learn throughout our lives?</li>\n	<li>How do we remember?</li>\n</ul>\nPsychology is an interesting subject and can help you understand your own life and behaviour.\n<h2>2. Explore research methods</h2>\nA major part of psychology is methodology. This is because it is used to conduct research and help describe and measure human behaviour. There are a number of methods that psychologists use. Some of these include: observations, experiments, case studies and survey?s. These are used to gather data, format theories, test predictions and interpret results.\n<h2>3.

Then you can! Here?s 5 reasons why you should take the first step towards entrepreneurial success - here\'s why you should start your own business today:\n<h2>Independence and flexibility</h2>\nOne of the main benefits of owning your own business is the flexibility that comes with it. You decide when you work, set your own hours, what you wear and when you go on holiday. It will also enable you to spend more time with your family.\n<h2>Follow your passion</h2>\nIf there?s something that you enjoy and have an interest in, then setting up your own business can be very satisfying. Following your passion won?t feel like work and no one has more pride in what they do than business owners.\n<h2>Success</h2>\nThe one thing business owners aim for is success. It opens up the possibility of making more money than you could make as an employee. You decide where your profits go. Maybe you want to give some to a charity? Personally give it back to the community? Or help you provide a living?\n<h2>Choose who works for you</h2>\nYou will have the opportunity to select who you work with. Choosing a skilled workforce will make your business more likely to succeed. You can pick people that are most suitable to work in your business and you think would fit in well.

Scientists are constantly studying this and have found that the way they learn information and organise themselves plays a major part in their success. So follow these 5 easy ways to improve your studying and propel yourself to the top of the class:\n\n<h2>Study in a quiet room</h2>\nFinding a suitable place to study is key to helping you learn. You want to make sure that the environment you choose is free from distractions and allows you to concentrate. Avoid places where people are constantly coming and going and don?t be afraid to ask for some privacy.\n<h2>Reduce distractions</h2>\nEver sat down to start studying, but got distracted and ended up on Facebook for hours? Yes, we all have! And if you?re like me it?s hard to resist the temptation of turning on the TV and checking social media. But if you want to become a happy and successful student, it?s time to turn off your phone, hide the remote and help stay committed to gaining your all-important qualification.\n<h2>Summarise what you have learnt</h2>\nThe worst thing you can do is copy information from your course materials. Summarising what you have learnt into 10 bullet points proves that you have fully understood the information and allows it to be retained in your memory.\n<h2>Make your learning fun</h2>\nStimulating your learning by using various strategies can improve your studying. You should try making flash cards, quizzing yourself, creating crazy stories or even teaching somebody else. By using these learning techniques, information is more likely to stay in your long-term memory.\n<h2>Make a study plan</h2>\nPlanning your study time is a great way to get organised and help you feel more relaxed about your learning. By sticking to plan you will be able to avoid those late-night cramming sessions and those struggles to complete your course on time.

There are distractions everywhere- phones, tablets, TV, Netflix.  Wee\'ve never had so much opportunity to procrastinate.  So here are a few tips to help you stay focused on studying and get the most out of your learning.\n\n\n<h2>Organise your space</h2>\n\nBy studying in a tidy environment you are more likely to concentrate, focus on your studies, and get it done. You should remove anything that can distract you and only have your study materials on the desk. Aim to spend 10 minutes cleaning at the end of every day, to help you maintain your organised study place. Turn your phone off and hide it in your draw until later, to stop temptation.\n\n<h2>Make a to-do list</h2>\n\nBy making a to-do list at the beginning of every day or week, will allow you to become more focused. You should prioritise your work, starting with the hardest tasks first. This will allow you to spend longer on them. Finish your day with the easier or more manageable tasks, as you will be less motivated. You should also prioritise to meet deadlines, this way you can spread out your workload.\n\n<h2>Manage your study time</h2>\n\nMake sure you allow a reasonable time frame to complete tasks. Write at the side of the to-do list how long the task will take to complete. You will then be able to fit your other commitments in with your schedule. You may also want to break down harder tasks with shorter, easier ones. This will help you stay motivated.\n\n<h2>Give yourself a break from studying</h2>\n\nRemember to give yourself a break. We know that you will have lots to do with your studies, but allow time to relax. For every hour of studying you should give yourself at least a 5-10 minute break. Giving your brain a break, will help you concentrate more when you get back to your studying. To remind yourself to have a break set a timer to go off every hour of studying. Try not to sit in the same place all day.

You can dedicate certain days and times for studying around all of your other commitments.  Determination and self-discipline will be needed to achieve success.\n<h2>Create a table with your current activities</h2>\nMake a one week time table and note:\n<ul>\n	<li>The daily activities you partake in</li>\n	<li>When you are at work/school</li>\n	<li>When you are at home and with family</li>\n	<li>When you eat and sleep</li>\n</ul>\nOnce you have done this, look for times you can dedicate your time to studying. These days and times may be consistent throughout every week.\n<h2>Develop a schedule</h2>\nFrom your current timetable, make a mark in your planner and calendar of all the available days and times devoted to studying. Make sure you block out your studying times on your calendar. You should do this by making it visible and bold, so you don?t forget it. You should also add the subject you are studying, in case you have more than one course to study. This will help you devote enough time to each.\n<h2>Determine your study goals</h2>\nCreate goals at the beginning of each week. For example: what you plan to accomplish and why? Once you have decided on your study goals, you will need to transfer your goals into your study plan. For example what you will be working on when studying.\n<h2>Stick to your schedule</h2>\nAlthough having no strict deadlines is one of the numerous benefits of home learning, you should still stick to your schedule. Even if it is just a rough estimate of when you want to finish your assignments. You will feel a lot better by spreading your work load out throughout the duration of your course. Therefore you will not be rushing to finish it at the end.\n<h2>Balance your schedule</h2>\nBy achieving a balanced schedule and making time for other activities, you will be more refreshed and devoted to studying when you come back to it. Make sure you give yourself some breaks or you will get discouraged and will be tempted to give up.\n\n<h2>When you make a study plan - you\'ll give yourself a better chance of success</h2>\n\nIncreasing numbers of students are attracted to distance learning but unless you have the discipline to keep working through your course it\'s unlikely you\'ll achieve what you want to achieve.

For example: something you saw in a documentary or an everyday experience.\n<h2>Keep going over information</h2>\nKeep saying the information over and over again (speaking out loud is best). You should do this until you don?t need your notes in front of you. The more times you go over it the less likely you are to forget it. You should keep going back to what you have learnt throughout the day/week to see if you can still remember it.\n<h2>Teach someone else</h2>\nA great way that you can memorise something is by teaching someone else. This will determine whether you have understood and learnt the information. If no one wants to listen to you, you can always teach the wall, just make sure no ones looking first!\n<h2>Use memory devices</h2>\nThere are many different devices to help with memorising. These include: mapping information, post it notes and note making. The best technique is using flash cards. These will help you break down information into smaller and easier chunks. This will be simpler to memorise and will be a quick memory buzz for you.\n<h2>Rhyming and story telling</h2>\nPutting information into a rhyme or story is another way of making it easier to remember.

Here are 10 tips on how to proofread.\n\n<h2>Come back to it</h2>\nIf you have time, leave your finished work for a few hours then come back to it and proofread it with fresh eyes. You are more likely to find those hidden mistakes.\n<h2>Break down what you are looking for</h2>\nYou should read through your report continuously and check your work for one problem at a time. Look and concentrate on the following: sentence structures, word choices, spelling and punctuation.\n<h2>Make sure information is accurate</h2>\nYou should double check all facts, figures and names, to make sure all of your information is correct.\n<h2>Use a spell checker</h2>\nA spell checker is great for finding repeated words, reversed letters, and many other common errors.\n<h2>Trust the dictionary</h2>\nA spell checker can only determine whether a word is a word. It will not tell you whether the meaning of the word is correct. For example fair and fare sound the same but have different meanings. Therefore check the spellings and meanings with a dictionary.\n<h2>Read your work backwards</h2>\nReading your work backwards (from right to left) enables you to spot spelling mistakes easier. This will help you focus on single words instead of sentences.\n<h2>Create a proofreading common mistake checklist</h2>\nMake a checklist of all the mistakes you commonly make. You can then refer back to your list each time you proofread.\n<h2>Ask someone to read your work</h2>\nAllow someone to read your work in order to catch any missed errors. Another set of eyes looking at your work may immediately be able to spot errors that you\'ve overlooked.\n<h2>Proofread using a hard copy</h2>\nPrint out your work and review it one line at a time. By reading your work on a printed version will help you find mistakes that you have previously missed.\n<h2>Read your work aloud</h2>\nBy you or someone you know reading your work aloud; you may hear a problem that you haven?t come across. This could be a faulty verb ending or a missing word.\n\n',NULL,NULL,9,'2017-03-13 14:10:08','2017-03-13 14:10:08',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/4249-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

The worst thing you can do is say no. So, make the most of it, get prepared and show you?re interested!\n<h2>No follow up</h2>\nDon?t just sit back and wait for a reply, follow it up. Send an email or a thank you letter to the interviewer and keep yourself fresh in their minds.\n<h2>Turning a weakness into a positive</h2>\nMany interviewers will ask you what your weakness is. Don?t try to turn a weakness into a positive, as they?ve probably heard it all before. You should focus on a skill you wish to improve and explain what you are doing to progress.\n<h2>Not doing your research</h2>\nThere?s no excuse for not researching the company before the interview. Show that you are keen to work with them, by finding out their mission statement, recent achievements and unique position. Make sure you impress them and stand out.\n<h2>Forgetting your manners</h2>\nYour recruiter will be watching your every move, what you say and body language, so don?t forget your manners!

Take a look at the different leadership styles and see which one you would fall into when running a business.\n\n<h2>Laissez-Fare</h2>\n\nA leader that is laissez-fare does not supervise employees directly and fails to provide their team with regular feedback. Employees would require little help and would be very skilled. This type of leader is very laid back and \'mostly anything goes\'.\n\n<h2>Autocratic</h2>\n\nAutocratic leaders make the decisions without including anyone else. No one challenges the decision made by the leader and employees are closely supervised. This type of leader is strict and focuses strongly on productivity.\n\n<h2>Democratic</h2>\n\nA democratic leader allows its employees to participate in decision making, however the end decision is made by the leader. They will listen to their team and take on board thoughts and opinions. This leadership provides employees with a sense of belonging, but decision making can be time consuming.\n\n<h2>Paternalistic </h2>\n\nA paternalistic leader acts as a fatherly or paternal figure to its team. The leader will guide and protect their employees like they are members of the same family. This type of leader provides good working conditions with the knowledge that their employees will work harder out of gratitude.\n\nSo have you decided which leadership style you would fall into?

You will need to schedule when things need to be completed by in order to stay on track and complete your course in the given time frame. Here are 5 time management tips you need to know:\n<h2>Planning</h2>\nWrite down in a planner or on a calendar when you wish to complete your assignments. You will then know how long to spend on each one and it will allow you measure your progress. Make sure you organise your work and your place of study, so you do not have any distractions whilst learning.\n<h2>Prioritise</h2>\nDon?t spend hours on a task that doesn\'t need to be completed any time soon. Start with more important tasks that have deadlines approaching. By prioritising your work  it will allow you to get the assignments that have shorter deadlines completed first. This will prevent you from falling behind and rushing your work at the end of your course.\n<h2>Reduce Interruptions</h2>\nStop and stay away from any interruptions whilst you study. Put your phone in your draw, even if social media is calling you! Tell the people you live with that you are studying and not to interrupt you. They will understand that you need to concentrate. Finding a quiet place to study will also help you to focus on your work.\n<h2>Don?t forget to have a break</h2>\nYou should aim to have a 5-10 minute break after every hour of studying. This break will allow your brain to rest before going back to your work. You should also remember to have a couple of days off from studying a week. Whatever you plan to do whether it?s meeting friends or even spending the day watching TV make sure you relax and enjoy yourself, so that you are ready to begin studying again.\n<h2>Get a good night\'s sleep</h2>\nYou should aim at getting 6-9 hours sleep at night. This will allow your brain to rest and help perform at its peak the following day. Research suggests that sleep plays an important role in memory, both before and after learning a new task. Lack of adequate sleep affects mood, motivation, judgement, and your perception of events.',NULL,NULL,9,'2017-04-06 11:51:29','2017-04-06 11:51:29',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/5060-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

Then you can do this by teaching yourself how to speed read, which will help when you are studying. Here are a few tips on how to speed read\n<h2>Stop talking to yourself</h2>\nThe majority of readers move their throats as if they were speaking the words. By doing this it slows down the speed you can read information. To prevent this from happening, you should chew gum or hum whilst reading.\n<h2>Hide words you?ve already read</h2>\nWhen reading you should cover the text that you have already read, as your eyes often move back to earlier words. This does not improve any understanding. If your eyes jump back to several lines behind, that is a sign you need to slow down.\n<h2>Understand eye movements</h2>\nIt has been proven that we can only read when our eyes have stopped moving. Your eyes move jerkily, skipping and stopping on random words. You should improve this line by line (although this may be difficult at first!). Studies show that you can read eight letters to the right of your eye position and four to the left. This works out to two or three words at a time.\n<h2>Make fewer eye movements</h2>\nYour brain decides where to move your eyes. It looks at how long or familiar the following words look. If you train your eyes to move to specific places on the page, it will allow you to read faster.\n<h2>Set a pace faster than you can understand</h2>\nIn order to become fast at reading and being able to understand the information, you need to set your pace faster than you would normally read. By doing this it will allow you to understand the main points quicker. Why not practice with this small exercise:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Whilst reading a piece of text, in your head say ?one one thousand? calmly. You should aim to finish the quote at the same time as finishing a line from the piece of text. Even if you don?t understand anything to begin with, this will help speed up your eye movement. You should keep repeating this whilst getting faster.</li>\n</ul>',NULL,NULL,9,'2017-03-29 13:48:39','2017-03-29 13:48:39',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/4395-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

It can either make or break a company and in this case it turned out to be a disaster for one of the leading fruit juice companies, Tropicana. Here\'s how their brand identity failure\n\nThey invested 35 million dollars into creating new packaging and advertising campaigns - which was the biggest mistake they could have made! This was launched in January 2009 and was first used on their best-selling product: Tropicana Pure Premium, which makes them more than 700 million dollars per year in North America.\n\nThe packaging was soon criticised as being ?ugly? and ?cheap? and people took to social media to make sure the company knew about it. As Tropicana is perceived as a premium brand, consumers were confused as to why they would create a ?low-range supermarket looking? brand.\n\nBecause of this, their sales dropped by 20% which resulted into a huge loss of 30 million dollars for Tropicana. When the disaster couldn\'t get any worse, competitors took advantage of the Tropicana crisis and gained most of their sales.\n\nIn February 2009 they announced that they would return to its original packaging and within a few months it was back on our shelves. In total this brand identity failure cost Tropicana a whopping 50 million dollars!\n\nWhat Tropicana forgot is that their consumers feel an emotional bond with the appearance of their products. By changing the designs so much people could no longer identify the brand with the product ? this is a vital factor to focus on before making changes to packaging. Tropicana?s main problem was that they changed too many of their brand elements, which confused their customers and had a negative effect on sales.\n\nI\'m sure this is a failure that Tropicana wants to forget!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/introduction-marketing-3.html\">Learn how you can create a successful brand identity on our Introduction to Marketing Level 3 course&gt;&gt;</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2017-03-30 13:28:25','2017-03-30 13:28:25',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/5369-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

Try learning in a library or room in your house and avoid places when you are likely to run into your friends or family!\n<h2>Plan</h2>\nWith no strict deadlines and being able to study at your own pace, you should consider setting your own targets. Noting down in a planner or on a calendar when you wish to complete your assignments will allow you to work out how long you have to complete each assessment and measure your progress.\n<h2>Prioritising</h2>\nDon?t spend hours or even days on a course that doesn?t need to be completed any time soon. Prioritising your work will enable you to finish assignments in a logical order and prevent you from falling behind.\n<h2>Ask for help</h2>\nIf you are unsure on anything do not hesitate to ask your tutor, even if you think the question is silly! Your tutor is there to help you any time of the day by email so ask away.

Here are 5 tips on how to achieve your goals:\n<h2>Decide what you want</h2>\nThe first thing you need to do is think about what you want to achieve. This can be either a big or small change - it is up to you! By taking your time to think about what you want is an important first step for helping you succeed. Do you want a distinction in your course? Do you want to achieve your dream job? You decide what you want! You then want to ask yourself why these are important to you and determine if these goals are realistic.\n<h2>Make a plan</h2>\nYou should start by brainstorming together thoughts about the following:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Your ideal future</li>\n 	<li>Qualities you admire in others</li>\n 	<li>Things that could be done better</li>\n 	<li>Things you want to learn more about</li>\n 	<li>Habits you want to improve</li>\n</ul>\nThese will get you thinking about how you can improve yourself and get you on your way to achieving your desired goals.\n<h2>Make your goals SMART</h2>\nAn effective way to assess your goals is to make them smart:\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>S</strong>pecific</li>\n 	<li><strong>M</strong>easurable</li>\n 	<li><strong>A</strong>chievable</li>\n 	<li><strong>R</strong>elevant</li>\n 	<li><strong>T</strong>ime-bounded</li>\n</ul>\nIf you have more than one goal you should rank these in order of importance. This will then show you which ones are the most meaningful to you.\n<h2>Dedicate your time</h2>\nTo achieve your goals you will need to put a lot of hard work and time into making them a reality. You should think about how long you expect it will take you to achieve them and when you want it to be completed. If you are truly committed to your goal you will need to dedicate your time on it. You should do this by building your efforts into a daily routine and scheduling your time to work on your goals every day.\n<h2>Track your performance</h2>\nWhen you are working towards your goal you should keep track of your progress. You could do this by keeping a journal, using an app or making a note in a diary. You will then be able to notice your improvements and study your performance, which will help you stay motivated. Use positive and negative reinforcement in order to push yourself to achieve your goals.\n\nReach for your dreams and start achieving your goals today!',NULL,NULL,9,'2017-04-03 13:39:31','2017-04-03 13:39:31',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/4959-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

QCF and they agreed.\"</blockquote>\n<h2>Navigating the course</h2>\nPreviously Natalie had completed an Open University Degree so she knew that studying was not limited to within the four walls of a college and in Spring 2015 she started researching all the study opportunities available.\n<blockquote>?I looked at local colleges, online learning and at all the options available.  Open Study College was the best route for me as it meant I could complete the course at my own pace and still be there to collect my children after school.  It also meant I could continue to work whilst I studied which kept the money coming in.?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n?This way of learning is absolutely perfect for anyone who needs an income whilst studying towards a new career.\"</blockquote>\n<h2>Flexible</h2>\nStarting her course in May 2015, Natalie enjoyed the flexibility that studying with Open Study College delivered.\n<blockquote>?I worked at my own pace and managed to complete some of the course before I started my official placement in September 2015. What was really interesting was the level of work I completed and the tutor support I received through Open Study was far superior to some of the more traditional routes offered.  I delivered 360 observations, essays, feedback and evidence which were very in depth. Yet, I had the beauty of working and studying around my children rather than 9-4 in a lecture room.?</blockquote>\nNatalie worked through the course quickly and took just six months to complete the level 3.  In less than one year after leaving her job, Natalie qualified as a teaching assistant and started working in a school.\n<blockquote>?I was delighted when I qualified in March 2016 and after a few months working in my children?s school, to build up my confidence; I signed up with a Teaching agency.  This would broaden my knowledge and experience.  I started a supply contract in the September and I worked at a variety of schools from rural to a tougher inner city school before settling in a permanent, full time position.?</blockquote>\n<h2>Rewards all round</h2>\nAs if the rewards from gaining a new qualification and career aren?t enough, Natalie says that the most rewarding is the lightbulb moments.\n<blockquote>?I love working with the children. It?s the most rewarding when you explain something and when they grasp the concept, when the lights turn on, that?s the moment which makes it all worthwhile.  It?s empowering the children with self-belief, unlocking their potential and showing them how to make the best of themselves.   It?s really rewarding for me and for my own children it means I?m the best mum I can be.  No more juggling.?</blockquote>\n<h2>Change is a wonderful thing.</h2>\n<blockquote>?It?s been life changing for me.  Not many people can say they love their job.  A year ago I couldn?t, now I can. It?s a career I love giving me the family flexibility I want. ?</blockquote>\nIf like Natalie you?d like to find out more about our CACHE and other courses to help you get a career you love <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/qualifications/cache\">visit our website</a>.\n\n<a class=\"blog-cta\" href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/cache-support-teach-schools-3.html\">Take a look at our CACHE Level 3 Certificate in Supporting Teaching and Learning in Schools course</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2017-04-19 14:41:53','2017-04-19 14:41:53',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/6920-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

Our CV tips can help you gain a competitive edge over fellow applicants.\n\nOn average, 250 people apply for an advertised position. It can be difficult to differentiate yourself when there are so many people applying for the same position.\n\nYour CV is an opportunity to sell yourself to a potential employer. It allows you to demonstrate that you are a great candidate for the position they are advertising.\n<h2>So, what are our CV tips?</h2>\n<h3><strong>Sell yourself</strong></h3>\nInclude a professional summary at the start of your CV to provide an overview of your key attributes and skills. It?s also wise to mention your intended career path to demonstrate your drive. Make sure it flows seamlessly and keep it under ten lines, otherwise your reader will switch off. Another good idea is to include power words such as innovative, adaptable and achieved. And lastly, try to avoid clichés to ensure that your CV isn?t tossed in the bin before they read the rest!\n<h3><strong>Achievements</strong></h3>\nHave you had any moments in your career so far that really stand out for you? That make you say ?wow, I?m so proud that did that!? If so, include them in your CV! Put an emphasis on results you have achieved, along with the facts and stats to back it up. If you have any new qualifications that you worked hard to achieve then include them on your CV too.\n<h3><strong>Customise</strong></h3>\nIt?s a good idea to subtly tailor your CV to the position you are applying for. Every job and every organisation is different so you may want to emphasise different skills or qualities for each application.\n<h3><strong>Showcase</strong></h3>\nNot only is it important to showcase your skills, but also your personality if you want to stand out. Think about including a skills profile that describes what you consider to be your key skills, for example, excellent communication skills. And to showcase your personality, try to include hobbies and interests that the reader may find engaging. You could even think about customising the design of your CV to reflect your personality? but forget including the selfie, save that for social media!\n<h3><strong>Keep it brief</strong></h3>\nTry to keep your CV to less than two pages and avoid waffling! Also think about ditching the unnecessary personal information such as marital status, nationality, etc. and keep it to just your name, address, contact information and blog/website if relevant. Don?t worry about including professional experience that isn?t necessary either, for example if you are applying for an accounting position, is it relevant that you worked part-time in a fast food outlet when you were 16? Keep your CV short, and to the point.\n\nIf you want to make your CV stand out with a new qualification then take a look at <a href=\"https://blog.openstudycollege.com/\"><strong>our website</strong></a> for further information on the courses we offer.\n\n<a class=\"blog-cta\" href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/contact_us.php\">Contact us</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2017-06-02 08:15:51','2017-06-02 08:15:51',2,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/?p=7068',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

It can be difficult to differentiate yourself when there are so many people applying for the same position.\n\nYour CV is an opportunity to sell yourself to a potential employer. It allows you to demonstrate that you are a great candidate for the position they are advertising.\n<h2>So, what are our CV tips?</h2>\n<h3><strong>Sell yourself</strong></h3>\nInclude a professional summary at the start of your CV to provide an overview of your key attributes and skills. It?s also wise to mention your intended career path to demonstrate your drive. Make sure it flows seamlessly and keep it under ten lines, otherwise your reader will switch off. Another good idea is to include power words such as innovative, adaptable and achieved. And lastly, try to avoid clichés to ensure that your CV isn?t tossed in the bin before they read the rest!\n<h3><strong>Achievements</strong></h3>\nHave you had any moments in your career so far that really stand out for you? That make you say ?wow, I?m so proud that did that!? If so, include them in your CV! Put an emphasis on results you have achieved, along with the facts and stats to back it up. If you have any new qualifications that you worked hard to achieve then include them on your CV too.\n<h3><strong>Customise</strong></h3>\nIt?s a good idea to subtly tailor your CV to the position you are applying for. Every job and every organisation is different so you may want to emphasise different skills or qualities for each application.\n<h3><strong>Showcase</strong></h3>\nNot only is it important to showcase your skills, but also your personality if you want to stand out. Think about including a skills profile that describes what you consider to be your key skills, for example, excellent communication skills. And to showcase your personality, try to include hobbies and interests that the reader may find engaging. You could even think about customising the design of your CV to reflect your personality? but forget including the selfie, save that for social media!\n<h3><strong>Keep it brief</strong></h3>\nTry to keep your CV to less than two pages and avoid waffling! Also think about ditching the unnecessary personal information such as marital status, nationality, etc. and keep it to just your name, address, contact information and blog/website if relevant. Don?t worry about including professional experience that isn?t necessary either, for example if you are applying for an accounting position, is it relevant that you worked part-time in a fast food outlet when you were 16? Keep your CV short, and to the point.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you want to make your CV stand out with a new qualification then take a look at <a href=\"https://blog.openstudycollege.com/\"><strong>our website</strong></a> for further information on the courses we offer.',NULL,NULL,9,'2017-05-12 15:30:03','2017-05-12 15:30:03',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/7068-revision-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

All your attention needs to be on the individual, in order to make them feel worthy, appreciated and respected. There are 3 types of strategies that a counsellor should use:\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Active Participation</strong> ? Listening whilst taking an interest in the individual</li>\n 	<li><strong>Reflective Listening</strong> ? Restating information so the client knows that you have understood what they have said</li>\n 	<li><strong>Blocks to Listening</strong> ? Blocking any distraction that can get in the way, including forming judgements</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Wanting to make a difference</h2>\nAfter listening to the individual, you will need to give support to help the client see things more positively. This may be getting them to look at things from a different view-point or focus on feelings, experiences or behaviour.

You will need to understand the situation from their point of view in order to address the issues.\n<h2>Patience</h2>\nYou must accept that a positive change in your client may not appear straight away. You may need to discuss something many times before they move in a particular direction.

Remember your personal tutor is also there to help you throughout your course, so ask them!\n<h2>Use diagrams and doodles</h2>\nUsing diagrams and doodles make large amounts of information easier to read and remember. You will be able to relate a doodle to key information, which will make it hard to forget important data.\n<h2>Quiz yourself</h2>\nIt is important you test yourself. Come up with questions from your course materials and try to answer them. At the end if any are wrong then this will show you what areas you need to work on and read over. Flashcards are great for testing your knowledge and boosting your memory - so why not give them a go!\n<h2>Get organised</h2>\nIn order to pass your course it is vital that you set yourself some study goals and create a plan. This will help in outlining what you need to do and when, making you keep yourself on track. Starting your course early will also help in getting that head start you need to familiarise yourself with the course structure and your tutors marking.',NULL,NULL,9,'2017-05-24 13:34:18','2017-05-24 13:34:18',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/7101-revision-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

Our CV tips can help you gain a competitive edge over fellow applicants.\n\nOn average, 250 people apply for an advertised position. It can be difficult to differentiate yourself when there are so many people applying for the same position.\n\nYour CV is an opportunity to sell yourself to a potential employer. It allows you to demonstrate that you are a great candidate for the position they are advertising.\n<h2>So, what are our CV tips?</h2>\n<h3><strong>Sell yourself</strong></h3>\nInclude a professional summary at the start of your CV to provide an overview of your key attributes and skills. It?s also wise to mention your intended career path to demonstrate your drive. Make sure it flows seamlessly and keep it under ten lines, otherwise your reader will switch off. Another good idea is to include power words such as innovative, adaptable and achieved. And lastly, try to avoid clichés to ensure that your CV isn?t tossed in the bin before they read the rest!\n<h3><strong>Achievements</strong></h3>\nHave you had any moments in your career so far that really stand out for you? That make you say ?wow, I?m so proud that did that!? If so, include them in your CV! Put an emphasis on results you have achieved, along with the facts and stats to back it up. If you have any new qualifications that you worked hard to achieve then include them on your CV too.\n<h3><strong>Customise</strong></h3>\nIt?s a good idea to subtly tailor your CV to the position you are applying for. Every job and every organisation is different so you may want to emphasise different skills or qualities for each application.\n<h3><strong>Showcase</strong></h3>\nNot only is it important to showcase your skills, but also your personality if you want to stand out. Think about including a skills profile that describes what you consider to be your key skills, for example, excellent communication skills. And to showcase your personality, try to include hobbies and interests that the reader may find engaging. You could even think about customising the design of your CV to reflect your personality? but forget including the selfie, save that for social media!\n<h3><strong>Keep it brief</strong></h3>\nTry to keep your CV to less than two pages and avoid waffling! Also think about ditching the unnecessary personal information such as marital status, nationality, etc. and keep it to just your name, address, contact information and blog/website if relevant. Don?t worry about including professional experience that isn?t necessary either, for example if you are applying for an accounting position, is it relevant that you worked part-time in a fast food outlet when you were 16? Keep your CV short, and to the point.\n\nIf you want to make your CV stand out with a new qualification then take a look at <a href=\"https://blog.openstudycollege.com/\"><strong>our website</strong></a> for further information on the courses we offer.\n\n<a class=\"blog-cta\" href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/contact_us.php\">Contact us</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2017-06-02 08:15:35','2017-06-02 08:15:35',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/7068-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

Here are our Frequently Asked Questions','a-level-faqs',NULL,NULL,'<h2>AQA / EdExcel information and Centres</h2>\n\nIf you would like a list of recommended Exam Centres please email studentsupport@openstudycollege.com\n\n<h2>The Changing Status of A and AS Levels</h2>\n\nAs you may know, the government?s overhaul of A-Levels and AS-Levels is now being implemented. Several changes have been made, but they only apply to courses with the new ?2015? specifications.\n\n<h2>Changes to exam deadlines for A-Levels</h2>\n\nAs you may know, the Government is making a number of changes to A Levels over the next few years. If you are still studying the old version of one of these subjects, with final exam dates in June 2017 or June 2018, then we strongly advise you to register with a centre as soon as possible in order to be sure of taking your exam with the old specification. Please note that Open Study College cannot be held responsible if you do not complete your coursework or register with a centre for the final exam.\n\n<h2>Why can\'t I post assignments to my Tutor?</h2>\n\nWe only allow students to post assignments in if the tutor agrees on whether the nature of the assignments requires physical materials to be sent in. Students generally submit assignments and receive their feedback by email. This is a simple, secure and effective method of communication\n\n<h2>How do I contact my Tutor?</h2>\n\nTutors can be contacted by email only. To receive your Welcome Letter and tutor contact information simply send an email to studentsupport@openstudycollege.com with your NAME, POSTCODE and EMAIL\n\n<h2>I want to take my exams but there are only a few months to study, is this possible?</h2>\n\nDepending on the time of year, it is sometimes impossible to complete your studies in a short space of time, as your practice papers have to be marked and checked. More importantly, the examination boards have cut off times for exam registration which are not flexible. Most exam centres will not accept new candidate registrations after February.\n\n<h2>When can I take my exams?</h2>\n\nExams are taken at the same times as schools and colleges, and are not flexible.

If you\'re not specific you will have to look through a heap of searches just to find what you want - and this can be time consuming. So narrow your search down and get to the point!\n<h2>Putting theory into practice</h2>\nIf you want to put your knowledge into practice why not conduct further research and watch video demonstrations. If you are studying our beauty course for example why not understand how to apply various treatments with videos from the internet. By conducting a simple search on YouTube will help discover how your theory knowledge fits in with actually doing it.\n<h2>Share and learn with other students</h2>\nCommunicating and sharing information about your course with other students is a great way to understand more about your studies. If you come across something you are not sure of why not ask other students? You will then be able to overcome your difficulties and even help other people! Why not join a student forum? Or even contact other students via Open Study College?s Facebook?\n<h2>Further research</h2>\nUsing more than one source is vital when carrying out your own research. Your tutors are looking to see that you have added credence to your writing and demonstrates that you have researched the subject thoroughly.

It\'s now a worldwide campaign to raise the profile of female engineers, and demonstrate that it\'s not just a career path for men.\n\nThe campaign is coordinated by the Women?s Engineering Society (WES), a charity encouraging women to achieve their full potential as engineers. WES want to create a diverse engineering sector where women are integral to the workforce. In order to achieve this, they are trying to bring down the barriers stopping women from progressing in their careers. These barriers include:\n<ul>\n 	<li>A lack of careers advice throughout education</li>\n 	<li>Engineering seen as career for brainy boys</li>\n 	<li>Inequalities in career progression</li>\n 	<li>Off-putting job descriptions</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why engineering?</h2>\n<h3>Choices, choices, choices?</h3>\nPicking the right sector for you is the first step towards your career as an engineer.

Graduate salaries are 20% higher than the average graduate salary, falling between £25,000 and £40,000. In addition, engineering apprentices are paid more than twice the national apprentice minimum wage.\n<h3>Continuous improvement</h3>\nLearning and development is also important in an engineer?s role. For example, a graduate may be working towards becoming chartered, or attending management courses. There will always be plenty of chances to grow and develop throughout your career. Ultimately, employers want to see their employees succeed in their business, and move up the career ladder.\n<h3>Travel Opportunities</h3>\nIf the chance to travel in your job is attractive to you then engineering could be a good career for you. Many engineers are expected to travel regularly as part of their job. You may visit a foreign supplier?s premises, travel to another city to see a construction site, or attend a conference or training day.\n<h3>Make a difference</h3>\nWe can see examples of great engineering all around us.

She was juggling everything from HR and Training, to Accounts and Wages. Having studied Accounts and Bookkeeping at school, Helen was familiar with some of the concepts but lacked the knowledge to efficiently complete daily tasks such as purchasing, sales invoicing, and payments.\n<h2>Goals</h2>\nHelen and her boss decided to make life easier in the long run by improving Helen?s Accounting knowledge and skills. Helen chose to study AAT Accounting Level 2 and 3 with the goal of becoming more efficient in her work. Helen?s boss currently outsources finalising the accounts to an external Accountant... a costly job! Accountants use a lot of jargon so Helen was also very keen to understand what he\'s talking about.\n<h2>Further Study</h2>\nImpressively, Helen?s studies moved at a very quick pace. Starting her level 2 course in September 2016, Helen was finished in 9 months, a great achievement whilst working part-time! Demonstrating her enthusiasm for developing her accounting knowledge, Helen has thrown herself into studying the level 3 course:\n<blockquote><em>?Level 3 is a natural progression, and will allow me to take on board more of the accounting process to lessen the need to outsource this?</em></blockquote>\n<h2>Why Open Study College?</h2>\nHelen chose to study with us because we ?stood out from the other training providers? she looked at.

Helen was also encouraged by the competitive pricing of the course compared to other providers.\n<h2>Simple and no pressure</h2>\nHelen enjoyed ?the simplicity of the approach to the learning? whilst completing her AAT Accounting level 2 course. Studying a course that?s broken down into bite-sized chunks with realistic assignment time-frames, meant Helen didn?t feel pressured or overwhelmed.\n\nShe kept in contact with her tutor on a regular basis, and liked that any additional help was available ASAP. Knowing her tutor was a quick email away if she had any questions or problems put Helen\'s mind at ease. Regular assessment also helped her to identify any areas she was struggling with, and make improvements, before sitting an exam.\n<h2>Valuable knowledge</h2>\nHelen?s studies have already proved to be very useful! Her course has given her the knowledge needed to ?effectively put into place a general ledger, purchase day book, sales day book, cash book, etc.? at work. Studying whilst working allowed Helen to put her new skills into practice daily, reinforcing her studies\n\nOnce Helen has completed her AAT Accounting level 3 course and is fully qualified, she will hopefully take over the books completely, and expand her responsibilities even further!

Which is why we have pulled together our top tips on becoming a great team leader.\n<h2>Appreciate &amp; motivate</h2>\nYou need to understand the importance of praise and how it affects an individual. Praising the actions of your team members, regardless of how small, will encourage them to continue the behaviour. Praise will motivate your team, and help them to feel appreciated and noticed. On the flip side, do not criticise or complain about members of your team at all. Try comparing their mistake with everything they do well to put things into perspective. Criticism will only demotivate your staff, instead use their mistake as an opportunity for development.\n<h2>Great leaders listen</h2>\nA good team leader will encourage their team to talk, whilst they actively listen and show a genuine interest in what they have to say. People want to feel important and be heard, try repeating what they have said to show you are listening, but don?t patronise them! No one likes to feel ignored or unappreciated.

Try to understand what they are saying and respect it, even if you disagree. If they say something that is wrong then be sensitive, don?t call them out or make them look bad in front of others. If you respect your team members, they will respect you.\n<h2>Admit it...</h2>\nWhen you are wrong or make a mistake, own up and admit it. Being honest and humble enough to admit when you are in the wrong is a great trait in a leader. Also, if you have the humility to apologise when you have made a mistake, your team members will respect you even more.\n<h2>A leader lights the way</h2>\nNaturally, as a team leader you want your team members to look up to you and view you as a role model.

Anybody beginning or extending a venture that will consume significant resources of money, energy or time and that\'s expected to return a profit should take the time to draft some kind of business plan. Here are 5 reasons why you need a business plan:\n<h2>Plan the future</h2>\nA business plan plays a vital part in helping to manage an organisation more effectively. You will be able to understand and improve your business better by putting your thoughts down on paper. It can help you set goals and objectives and give you information on how you can achieve these.\n<h2>Help grow and secure funding</h2>\nAn up to date business plan is essential in order to gain funding. As the market for funding is highly competitive, all lenders will require access to your business plan along with recent income statements.\n<h2>Communicating a course of action</h2>\nA business plan can help you focus on future opportunities and follow a particular course of action. Milestones can be set and you can focus on key tasks which will help to monitor progress. The plan can be changed quickly if it is not helping your business succeed and a more suitable plan can be produced.\n<h2>Managing the cash flow</h2>\nCareful management of a business?s cash flow is important if you want your company to succeed. Many organisations fail, as they are unable to pay their debts. A well-structured business plan will help you manage your cash flow and help you stay on track.\n<h2>Avoid big mistakes</h2>\nIt is a waste of time and effort if you start up a business and it fails in a year. Many founders have learnt the hard way and didn\'t have a viable way to make money. Developing and sharing a business plan can help avoid going down the wrong path, as you will have taken different factors into consideration. So start creating your business plan today for a successful future!\n\nAre you looking to start up your own business and need to know how to create a successful business plan?\n\nThen enrol today on our <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/starting-your-own-business.html\">Level 3 Starting your own business course!</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/starting-your-own-business.html\">Take a look at our Starting your own business level 3 course &gt;&gt;</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2017-09-22 15:43:20','2017-09-22 15:43:20',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/5331-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

Getting to know your customers, hiring the right staff and marketing effectively all play an important part in how well the business performs. And here?s some tips that can help you:\n<h2>Provide excellent customer service</h2>\nFrom the first point of contact to the last, your customer should be offered a great service, but they also should be provided with an excellent experience. That and creating a professional environment are a key in building customer loyalty and growing rapports with your clients.\n<h2>Hire the right staff</h2>\nA skilled workforce plays a big part in the successful running of your business. You?ll need to employ those that are qualified and know what they?re doing, making you stand out from your competitors. Failure to do this could have a detrimental effect on the business and your reputation. You?ll also need to consider personality and whether they hold the social skills to deal with customers on a daily basis.\n<h2>Grow your salon</h2>\nIf your beauty salon is in full swing and is bringing you in a nice income, you may want to consider growing your business by proving other treatments.

A language qualification could be the difference between you and another candidate in getting the job you?ve always wanted. So now\'s the right time to gain that vital language skill that will lead you to a successful future! Here are 5 benefits of learning a new language:\n<h2>New opportunities</h2>\nSpeaking two or more languages can improve your employment prospects. As the world is continuously changing, most companies are doing business in multiple countries around the world. They would not be able to do this without someone who has language skills. This will also open up opportunities for you to travel to foreign countries during your career. Having a second language will certainly set you apart from other applicants.\n<h2>It\'s great for your brain</h2>\nResearch has shown that there are several cognitive benefits to learning another language. The positive effects include memory improvement, longer attention span, and a reduced risk of age-related cognitive decline.\n<h2>Establishing connections and friendships</h2>\nHave you ever wanted to understand what someone is saying when they are talking in a different language?  Has this ever happened to you? Maybe you\'re visiting a German market and you would love to order your food in German, but you can only ask in your native language.  There is an instant regret when you realise how the experience could be enriched. Why not learn the language that interests you? O, you may even have a friend who speaks a different language and want to communicate with them more effectively.\n<h2>Become more interesting</h2>\nEnglish is one of the most common languages in the world, meaning many of us tend not to make the effort to learn another language... instead we expect others to speak our language. If you decide to learn another language then you?re rare breed. You will have more engaging conversations about a variety of topics that you wouldn?t have had otherwise. Be multilingual and become more interesting!\n<h2>Stay smart when travelling</h2>\nAnother perk is that you will have no trouble with translations when you go travelling. Wouldn\'t it be nice to speak freely to locals? Or follow signs easily and know exactly what things mean? Learning a new language will  enable you to have a much better experience and allow you to communicate to lots more people.\n\nAre you interested in learning a new language? Maybe you want to achieve a new job? Or gain your skills to climb the career ladder?

So check out these tips to writing the perfect assignment:\n<h2>Prepare and Plan</h2>\nYou should try to read the question a number of times and rewrite it into your own words to make sure you know what is asked of you.  Check and study the assessment criteria to understand how you can achieve those higher grades and draft out a plan so you know you have addressed everything that is needed. With your course materials and other resources gather together information that you can use in your assignment ? just remember this must be relevant to the assignment.\n<h2>Structure</h2>\nProducing the perfect structure is vital in an assignment. You should follow this structure:\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Begin you assignment with a clear introduction outlining what the assignment will discuss, the aim and purpose and a brief background about what it will be based on.</li>\n 	<li><strong>Body:</strong> You should always include an argument about the assignment topic in the body of your paragraph. To do this each paragraph should contain a new point stating either an advantage or disadvantage. The information in each paragraph should be linked.</li>\n 	<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> End your assignment with a conclusion which informs the reader the most important points made or main linkage of ideas. You should refrain from including any new information and instead give a comment, resolution or suggestion about the assignment question.</li>\n</ul>\nNever use ?I? and ?you? in your assignment, as academic writing is impersonal. Build on arguments, by using opinions and evidence from a variety of sources. Try to provide different perspectives so you can present a clear, unbiased assignment. If you need to add your overall opinion in your conclusion you should do so indirectly. For example use ?in my opinion? and avoid using ?I think?.\n<h2>Referencing</h2>\nAll assignments submitted to Open Study College should be referenced in the Harvard format. When you have included quotes and information from other sources you should make sure these are referenced correctly. At the end of your assignment you need to provide a reference list which includes all the sources you have used. These need to be structured in an alphabetical order of the authors? surname (A-Z). If the author is unknown you should still include the source alphabetically. For example: ?BBC News? would be listed under B. Take a look at how you can <a href=\"http://support.openstudycollege.com/solution/articles/26006-how-do-i-include-referencing-in-my-assignments-\">reference your work appropriately</a>.\n\nDon?t forget if you need any help with your assignments please get in touch with your tutor and they?ll be happy to help!\n\nGood luck with writing your perfect assignment!',NULL,NULL,9,'2017-10-09 11:04:03','2017-10-09 11:04:03',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/5768-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

Then take a look at how making a plan, summarising information and becoming familiar with the mark scheme can help you prepare for your exam. Here are 5 exam preparation techniques:\n<h2>Research what you don?t understand</h2>\nThere?s nothing worse than having a question come up in your exam that you don?t know the answer to. So make sure you?re confident that you will be able to answer all questions ? even if you only know the basic details. Go back through your notes and write down the things that you don?t understand and then do some research on it. <a href=\"https://blog.openstudycollege.com/top-tips-for-using-the-internet-for-research\">Take a look here for top tips for using the internet for research</a>. Don?t forget to ask your personal tutor if you?re unsure on anything.\n<h2>Make a plan</h2>\nPlanning your study time is a great way to get organised and help you feel more relaxed. Sticking to a plan will allow you to avoid those late-night cramming sessions and those struggles to fit all your revision in. <a href=\"https://blog.openstudycollege.com/make-study-plan\">Find out how to make a study plan here</a>.\n<h2>Look at the mark scheme</h2>\nBefore you go into the exam make sure you take a thorough look at the marking scheme. It?s a great to know exactly what examiners are looking for and what to include in an answer. Completing mock past papers and marking your own exams is a perfect in becoming familiar with this.\n<h2>Summarise information</h2>\nIf you can?t explain what you have learnt after each topic then you have not fully understood the information. After each page of your course materials get into the habit of summarising what it is about (roughly 5 bullet points will do). Don?t just read the information? make sure you understand it!\n<h2>Prioritise your study time</h2>\nIf you want to achieve a good grade in your exam you should prioritise your study time. We know you may have other important commitments such as work and looking after children, but you should think about putting your study time before your social plans. Say no to meeting up with friends and concentrate on your studies.\n\nBest of luck with your exams!',NULL,NULL,9,'2017-10-10 10:46:22','2017-10-10 10:46:22',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/7177-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

When you find that your mental wellbeing has started to decline, it can be difficult to know how to improve it. But, hopefully, our top tips can help you to improve your mental wellbeing and feel better about yourself.\n<h2>Look after yourself</h2>\nIt\'s important to treat yourself and your body right to maintain mental wellbeing. A poor diet, smoking and drinking alcohol can all negatively affect your state of mind. For this reason, it is important to fuel your body with a nutritious diet and look after yourself properly. You also need to make sure you are getting enough sleep, because getting too much or too little can have a huge impact on how you feel mentally.\n<h2>Be active</h2>\nExercise isn?t just great for your physical health, but your mental health too! There are close links between being physically active and your mental wellbeing. That doesn?t mean that you need to spend hours in the gym every day either? it could simply be getting outdoors and having a stroll on your lunch break, or going for a swim. Basically, find a physical activity that you enjoy and try to do it a few times a week, and you will feel much better for it!\n<h2>Socialise</h2>\nSocial interactions and good relationships are key to maintaining your mental health. This is because spending time with friends, family and the wider community helps you to feel happier and more secure. Human beings are social by nature, and building relationships with those around you help to improve your sense of belonging, and remove any feelings of isolation and loneliness.\n<h2>Set goals</h2>\nAre you finding that you have too much to do? Maybe you don?t know where to start? Or, there could be factors in your life that are stressing you out, such as money worries. Stress is not good for our mental health so it?s important that you identify what is causing your stress. A great way to deal with these stress factors and improve your mental wellbeing, is to set yourself achievable goals. Once you have your goal in mind, sit down and write a plan on how you are going to achieve your goal. You\'ll start to feel more relax, knowing that you have a plan to tackle the source of your stress.\n<h2>Keep learning</h2>\nAccording to the NHS, it is vital that we continue to learn throughout our lives to maintain our mental health and wellbeing. Learning something new could be something as big as learning a new language, or as simple as learning how to bake something new. Learning a new skill boosts your confidence, makes you happier and is great for your mental health... so, learning something new is officially good for you!\n\nTo find out more about improving your mental wellbeing, go to <a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/\">Mind?s website.</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2017-10-10 12:42:34','2017-10-10 12:42:34',2,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/?p=7591',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

Is it right for me?','7550-autosave-v1',NULL,NULL,'A career as a life coach can have many perks from gaining a high salary to making a big difference to someone?s life. If you?re thinking about going into this field of work then here?s 5 reasons why you should:\n<h2>Job opportunities</h2>\nThere are a wide range of job opportunities within this field of work. And with more people realising the importance of a life coach, becoming stressed due to work commitments and needing some guidance in their life, these roles are in high demand. You can work one-to-one with your clients from home or start your own life coaching business.\n<h2>Flexible work</h2>\nBecoming a life coach is one of the most flexible careers. You will be able to work from home or visit your client whenever you choose, giving you the ability to complete your other administrative tasks when you want. Some life coaches don?t even meet their clients face to face! They conduct their sessions by telephone.\n<h2>Great salary</h2>\nFancy earning up to £50,000 per year? Who wouldn?t! Life coaches are very well paid especially when you specialise in a specific niche such as relationships, health and wellbeing, business coaching and more! You can charge up to £60 a session, so if you want to boost your earning potential this is a great area to go in to.\n<h2>It?s easy to start your own business</h2>\nA life coaching business can be incredibly easy to set up compared to a traditional business, and has very low overheads. As long as you have internet and a telephone, you can get started without an office or staff. A great opportunity if you?ve always wanted to start your own business and be your own boss.\n<h2>Make a difference</h2>\nMaking a valuable contribution to helping others to overcome challenges and achieve their goals, is very rewarding. This is one of the main reasons why people choose to go into this field. With the motivation to helping others you?ll also be able to work on yourself, developing your own skills and learning new things.\n\nKick-start your career as a life coach with our <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/life-coaching-3.html\">Level 3 course</a>!\n\n<a class=\"blog-cta\" href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/creative-writing-level-3.html\">Take a look at our Creative Writing course</a>\n\n<a class=\"blog-cta\" href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/fiction-writing-course.html\">Take a look at our Fiction Writing course</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2017-11-07 16:18:47','2017-11-07 16:18:47',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/7550-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

If you\'re thinking of writing a novel, it?s important that you know where to start. But at the same time, it can be difficult to get going. The best piece of advice we can give is to stick with it when writing gets tough. Here?s our top tips on how to write a great novel?\n<h2>A good starting point</h2>\nThe best place to start is to decide which genre you are going to write. Spend some time exploring the characteristics of different genres, and familiarise yourself with the features. Try to stick to a genre that you are already familiar with and read regularly, you?ll find it much easier to write in a style that you enjoy reading.\n<h2>Planning is key</h2>\nIdentify your main character and the setting before you start to write your novel. The main character is a vital part of any story, so you need to know them inside out. We would recommend writing a character profile for any main characters, detailing everything from their name, age and where they live, to what their flaws are, and what they like and dislike. Creating these profiles will help you to build up the bigger picture of how they fit into your novel.\n\nIt is important to outline your novel before you begin to write it. It?s a good idea to map out your story?s key moments and plot twists to help you stay on track. You could even consider briefly writing the ending of your novel so that you know where your story is heading. Try to include as much information as possible when writing your initial outline, but don?t be afraid to stray from it if you think of a better idea whilst writing. If you do decide to make changes to your plot, sit back and think carefully about how this will impact on your character?s story lines.\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\nTry to use your own life experiences when looking for inspiration in your fiction writing. It will help you to write from the heart, and make it more believable from your readers perspective. A great example of an author using life experiences to inspire their writing is when J.K. Rowling was writing the Harry Potter series. J.K. Rowling was inspired used her experience of depression in her twenties as inspiration for the dementor creatures.\n<h2>Bring the emotion</h2>\nCreate characters that your readers will either fall in love with or hate, and persuade them to become completely immersed in the story line. You want your readers to be fully sucked into your story and feel what your characters feel. When creating your characters, write about them in a way that makes them feel passionately about the character, whether it be positive or negative. The reason E.L. James? Fifty Shades trilogy was so successful was because she portrayed a character that her readers were intrigued by and fell head over heels in love with. Women worldwide went crazy for Christian Grey, and that wasn?t an accident! When writing your novel you want to make your readers laugh, make them cry, and make them fall in love? it?s so important that you understand how to engage with your audience and make them feel!\n\nIf you are interested in finding out more about writing a novel, Open Study College offer two courses that could help you.

A study plan will help you to achieve your academic goals, and get through the exam period stress-free without losing hair or sleep!\n<h2>What is a Study Plan?</h2>\nA study plan is a schedule created to block out chunks of time for you to dedicate to studying a chosen subject. The aim is to study consistently to achieve a desired exam result. They can be used to study for big exams, or even, everyday learning. If you want to absorb and understand your learning materials better then a study plan is an effective tool.\n<h2>Essential Planning</h2>\nA study plan is not just a timetable setting out when you are going to study. It defines your methodology for studying a certain subject, including when, where and how you will study. It helps you to feel organised and in control, covering all topics, rather than studying random topics at random times.\n<h2>Set Targets</h2>\nFor each subject, set yourself mini targets to meet throughout your studies. Each time you reach one of these targets you will feel a sense of achievement. You will start to enjoy meeting these targets and it will motivate you to move on to the next one. Setting targets also helps you to prioritise your subjects, it could be as simple as knowing that you need to spend 10 hours studying a subject you need to work on, and only 4 hours on a subject you are already good at.\n<h2>Mental Wellbeing</h2>\nStudying regularly, rather than last minute cramming, helps to reduce your stress levels leading up to an exam. It?s also great for your mental health to create a study plan as it helps you to avoid panicking and studying into the early hours. Sticking to a study plan will also help improve your concentration and self-discipline levels, a huge boost to your mental wellbeing.  And, another bonus is that a study plan will help create more time for relaxation and leisure activities!\n<h2>Just remember?</h2>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Don?t be too ambitious when setting your end goal</li>\n 	<li>Be consistent and stick to your plan for effective studying</li>\n 	<li>Ask for help or advice from tutors or mentors when you need it</li>\n</ul>',NULL,NULL,9,'2017-11-13 10:08:31','2017-11-13 10:08:31',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/7289-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

Most commonly is a passion and talent for makeup; knowing makeup trends, knowing the best products, and being creative and skilled in your application are key traits of a successful freelance makeup artist. Organisation and punctuality are also vital to ensure that you can manage your clients efficiently and make a great impression by always being on time.\n<h3><strong>What does the role of a freelance makeup artist entail? </strong></h3>\nThe role of a freelance makeup artist is to ensure your clients look and feel their best.

It allows you to work with children and young people of various ages, whether in a primary or secondary school in a variety of areas. Duties can range from assisting in a classroom with daily activities, to giving support a special needs child, or even helping with the end of year production; the range is endless.\n<h2><strong>Which </strong><strong>Teaching Assistant</strong><strong> courses are right for me?</strong></h2>\nYou don?t need a specific qualification to become a teaching assistant. All that is required is a basic competency in literacy and numeracy. Easy enough, right?\n\nBut what we would suggest is to get ahead of the game and enrol on one of our Teaching Assistant courses. Our distance learning courses give you a great advantage due to their vast and detailed content.\n\nThere are a few questions that you should ask yourself when deciding which course to enrol on:\n<ul>\n 	<li>What do I already know?</li>\n 	<li>What kind of teaching assistant do I want to be?</li>\n</ul>\nIf you are a complete beginner, the <u>Teaching Assistant Level 2</u> is a great place to start. It goes into depth about the basic principles, and allows you to understand the challenges you may face in your role. It even explains the safeguarding regulations and how to handle specific situations.\n\nThose who are interested in a more specialised field may be more interested in the <u>Teaching Assistant Level 2 and Child Psychology Level 3</u> bundle course. Or perhaps the <u>Teaching Assistant and Special Needs Level 3</u>. These courses incorporate the basic principles of being a teaching assistant with the specialised information of the chosen sector.\n<h2><strong>How can Open Study College help me?</strong></h2>\nWe are here to help from the beginning to the end of your study journey.\n\nWe have a team of professionally trained Student Advisers who know the ins and outs of our Teaching Assistant courses, and will be able to inform you of the right course for you.\n\nYour personal tutor will assist you through the course, and assess you through regular assignments.

It allows you to work with children and young people of various ages, whether in a primary or secondary school in a variety of areas. Duties can range from assisting in a classroom with daily activities, giving support a special needs child, or even helping with the end of year production; the range is endless.\n<h2><strong>Which </strong><strong>Teaching Assistant</strong><strong> courses are right for me?</strong></h2>\nYou don?t need a specific qualification to become a teaching assistant. All that is required is a basic competency in literacy and numeracy. Easy enough, right?\n\nBut what we would suggest is to get ahead of the game and enrol on one of our Teaching Assistant courses. Our distance learning courses give you a great advantage due to their vast and detailed content.\n\nThere are a few questions that you should ask yourself when deciding on what course to enrol on:\n<ul>\n 	<li>What do I already know?</li>\n 	<li>What kind of teaching assistant do I want to be?</li>\n</ul>\nIf you are a complete beginner, the <u>Teaching Assistant Level 2</u> is a great place to start. It goes into depth about the basic principles, and allows you to understand the challenges you may face in your role. It even explains the safeguarding regulations and how to handle specific situations.\n\nThose who are interested in a more specialised field may be more interested in the <u>Teaching Assistant Level 2 and Child Psychology Level 3</u> bundle course. Or perhaps the <u>Teaching Assistant and Special Needs Level 3</u>. These courses incorporate the basic principles of being a teaching assistant with the specialised information of the chosen sector.\n<h2><strong>How can Open Study College help me?</strong></h2>\nWe are here to help from the beginning to the end of your study journey.\n\nWe have a team of professionally trained Student Advisers who know the ins and the outs of our Teaching Assistant courses, and will be able to inform you of the right course for you.\n\nYour personal tutor will assist you through the course, and assess you through regular assignments. If you have any queries or problems, they will be there to help.\n\nThe course will be provided in either an online or study pack format for you to study at your own pace. Adjust your learning around your schedule and make it work best for you.\n\n<strong>Where do I start?</strong>\n\nBrowse our online catalogue <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/teaching-assistant_courses.html\"><strong>here</strong></a> or give our team a call on <strong>03300 563100</strong> to start your journey to your dream career today!',NULL,NULL,9,'2017-12-14 15:36:24','2017-12-14 15:36:24',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/7843-revision-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

You?ve changed from an application form sitting in a pile on someone?s desk to a potential candidate.\n\nBut this is where the pressure sets in.\n\nYou now have 30 minutes to an hour to impress your potential future employer. What do you do??\n\nWell, that?s a pretty broad spectrum; it all depends on your working industry. But there are some general things which can work for all types of interviews to tell you what <em>not</em> to do.\n\nHere are 7 of the deadliest interview mistakes, and how you can avoid them:\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h3>Forgetting which job you have applied for</h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\nWhen applying for jobs, many of us tend to send out mass applications in order to increase our chances. So when we get an interview it can be hard to remember which job it is for.\n\n<strong>How to avoid:</strong> Keep a note of all jobs you have applied for and their adverts; when you get a response, bring out that advert and re-read the specification so you are clear with the position.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h3>Turning up late</h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\nPunctuality is key.\n\nThis is the first impression your employer will get of you on the day of the interview. Turning up late shows that you were not prepared in planning your time, and it will be assumed that this is a recurring trait of yours.\n\n<strong>How to avoid:</strong> Plan your journey in advance. If it is somewhere you have never been before then research the quickest way to get there, leaving some time for traffic or lateness.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h3>Bad appearance</h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\nVisual impressions are key in helping the employer decide, so looking scruffy or unprofessional will give a bad impression.\n\n<strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Plan an outfit ahead of time. If you do not own many professional clothes, buy or borrow some for the purpose of the interview.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h3>Being unprepared</h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\nTurning up unprepared will tell the employer that you are not interested in the job and seem as if you are wasting their time.\n\n<strong>How to avoid:</strong> Research the company in depth and have some answers prepared for standard interview questions. This will show your dedication and interest in the job. Also ensure that your experience is relevant for the job. Study a course to put your CV ahead of the competition.\n\n<a class=\"blog-cta\" href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/pages/how-it-works.html\">Take a look at Open Study College courses</a>\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h3>Negative body language</h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\nBody language sends signals to the brain that translates them into positive or negative feelings. Slouching, seeming unfocused or fidgety displays signs of disinterest and shyness.\n\n<strong>How to avoid:</strong> Sit up straight, focus on the interviewer(s), and look into their eyes when speaking and listening to show attentiveness and confidence.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h3>Being negative or defensive</h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<em><strong>DO NOT</strong> </em>speak badly of your previous employer! If something is said that you don?t agree with, do not get angry and defensive as this will give a bad impression.\n\n<strong>How to avoid:</strong> Think of a reasonable way to explain your departure, if asked, and always try to put a positive spin on any criticism or rebuttals that you have to say.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h3>Not asking any questions</h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\nAn interview is a two-way street.

	(1505,'7 Deadly Interview Mistakes and How to Avoid Them','7979-revision-v1',NULL,NULL,'If you have ever applied for a job (which I?m guessing most of us have), you know that getting an interview is a big task in itself. You?ve changed from an application form sitting in a pile on someone?s desk to a potential candidate.\n\nBut this is where the pressure sets in.\n\nYou now have 30 minutes to an hour to impress your potential future employer. What do you do??\n\nWell, that?s a pretty broad spectrum; it all depends on your working industry. But there are some general things which can work for all types of interviews to tell you what <em>not</em> to do.\n\nHere are 7 of the deadliest interview mistakes, and how you can avoid them:\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol>\n 	<li>Forgetting which job you have applied for</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen applying for jobs, many of us tend to send out mass applications in order to increase our chances. So when we get an interview it can be hard to remember which job it is for.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>How to avoid:</strong> Keep a note of all jobs you have applied for and their adverts; when you get a response, bring out that advert and re-read the specification so you are clear with the position.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>Turning up late</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\nPunctuality is key.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is the first impression your employer will get of you on the day of the interview. Turning up late shows that you were not prepared in planning your time, and it will be assumed that this is a recurring trait of yours.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>How to avoid:</strong> Plan your journey in advance. If it is somewhere you have never been before then research the quickest way to get there, leaving some time for traffic or lateness.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li>Bad appearance</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\nVisual impressions are key in helping the employer decide, so looking scruffy or unprofessional will give a bad impression.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>How to avoid it:</strong> plan an outfit ahead of time. If you do not own many professional clothes, buy or borrow some for the purpose of the interview.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAppearance is what\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li>Negative body language</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\nBody language sends signals to the brain that translates them into an impression. Slouching, seeming unfocused or fidgety displays signs of disinterest and shyness.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>How to avoid:</strong> Sit up straight, focus on the interviewer(s), and look into their eyes when speaking and listening to show attentiveness and confidence.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"5\">\n 	<li>Being unprepared</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\nTurning up unprepared will tell the employer that you are not interested in the job and seem as if you are wasting their time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>How to avoid:</strong> Research the company in depth and have some answers prepared for standard interview questions. This will show your dedication and interest in the job.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"6\">\n 	<li>Being negative or defensive</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\nDO NOT speak badly of your previous employer! And if something is said that you don?t agree with, do not get angry and defensive as this will give a bad impression.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>How to avoid:</strong> Think of a reasonable way to explain your departure if asked, and always try to put a positive spin on any criticism or rebuttals that you have to say.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"7\">\n 	<li>Not asking any questions</li>\n</ol>\nAn interview is a two-way street. If you do not ask any question, it will seem as if you are not interested or haven?t prepared enough to ask any questions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>How to avoid:</strong> Think of some questions before you arrive and even during the interview, based on what they have said or asked.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSometime nerves can take over and some of these mistakes can slip in naturally.

The mind has a large influence over our mood and state of being; find positives in everything and you will emit this positivity into other aspects of your life.\n\n<strong>e.g.</strong> appreciate the fact that you are fortunate to have a job at all; or that your teammate has made you a great cup of tea. Or even that whatever day it may be, it is one day closer to the weekend and your next day off. This is a well-known method for reducing stress.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong>Listen to music</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\nDepending on the type of industry that you work in, it may be easier to avoid stress if you block out unnecessary distractions and annoyances. While you?re working, plug in your headphones and listen to some music to focus you on the things immediately around you.\n\nClassical and instrumental music is supposed to be quite calming and soothing, but if hardcore rock is what does it for you then get some on and enjoy your peace.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong>Get some fresh air and exercise</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\nWithin the confined space of a working environment, fresh air is often hard to come by. Having several people in a small space drastically reduces the amount of oxygen you take in, and therefore reduces the amount of oxygen that reaches your brain. This can lead to fatigue which can lead to irritation and stress.\n\nOn your lunch break, take a 10-minute walk outside to get some fresh air and a bit of exercise. Exercise releases endorphins that make us feel calmer and happier.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong>Have a cup of tea</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\nTaking a break to make a cup of tea (and a biscuit ? go on, you deserve it!) will reduce stress as you are distancing yourself from your work ? even if it is just for 5 minutes.\n\nOffer to make a cup of tea for a work colleague and have a quick catch up to instantly perk up your mood and reduce stress.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong>Keep your work and home life separate</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\nYour work life and home life are separate. Keeping them separate will keep your stress confined to your working establishment, and stop stress spilling into your personal life.\n\nWhere possible, never bring work home with you. If you are a teacher, do your marking in any free periods or stay slightly later after school to do it. If you work in an office, plan your day so you have enough time to finish your tasks while at work.\n\nEveryone has many different ways they choose to relieve stress. These suggestions are all well and good but if they don?t work for you then there is no point in them.\n\nTake some time out of your day to do something that makes you happy.

Having several people in a small space drastically reduces the amount of oxygen you take in, and therefore reduces the amount of oxygen that reaches your brain. This can lead to fatigue which can lead to irritation and stress.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOn your lunch break, take a 10 minute walk outside to get some fresh air and a bit of exercise. Exercise releases endorphins that make us feel calmer and happier.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Have a cup of tea</strong></li>\n</ul>\nTaking a break to make a cup of tea (and a biscuit ? you deserve it!) will reduce stress as you are distancing yourself from your work ? even if it is just for 5 minutes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOffer to make a cup of tea for a work colleague and have a quick catch up to instantly perk up your mood and reduce stress.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Keep your work life and your home life separate\n</strong>Your work life and home life are separate; they are given different names for a reason. Keeping them separate will keep your stress confined to the walls of your working establishment, and stop stress spilling over into your personal life.\n\nWhere possible, never bring work home with you. If you are a teacher, do your marking in any free periods or stay slightly later after school to do it. If you work in an office, plan your day so you have enough time to finish your tasks while at work.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nEveryone has many different ways they choose to relieve stress. These suggestions are all well and good but if they don?t work for you then there is no point in them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTake some time out of your day to do something that makes you happy. If it works, then this is your own personal way of reducing stress that you should resort to when you need it most.',NULL,NULL,9,'2018-01-24 10:15:06','2018-01-24 10:15:06',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/8035-revision-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

The location has great footfall and we wish them every success.\"\n\nLabour MP for Dudley North, Ian Austin, officially opened the pop-up shop yesterday and said: \"I think we have to make improving education, boosting skills and getting people back into work across the Midlands our number one priority so I was delighted to see the pop-up shop and hear about the flexible learning options Open Study College have to offer.  The introduction of their scholarship scheme this year and their support of local charities shows that they are also a company who is giving back to the Midlands which should be applauded.\"\n\nThe pop-up shop college will be at Link Street near The Bullring and will run for two weeks from 5th February through to 18th February.  The team from Open Study College will be on hand from 10am to 8pm each day to answer questions and there will be a whole range of fun activities available to show the people of Birmingham how flexible today?s way of learning really is.\n\nSteven added \"We are always proud to innovate and do things differently for the good of our customers, and this pop-up store is a perfect example of that; a fantastic start to the year.\"\n',NULL,NULL,9,'2018-02-06 10:34:59','2018-02-06 10:34:59',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/8092-revision-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

Practical training allows you to practice your skills and perfect the skills you have previously learnt.\n<h3><strong>Get additional help</strong></h3>\nIf there is anything you are unsure of, practical training will allow you to practice any skills and ask for any additional help that you may need before completing your course.\n<h3><strong>Improve your career prospects</strong></h3>\nMany employers appreciate the value of practical training. It will allow them to see that you have put your theory into practice and have experience within the field ? which is vital!\n\nIn a list of candidates who have studied a Beauty Therapy course, having also attended practical training will set your apart from your competition.\n<h3><strong>Widen your contacts</strong></h3>\nAttending a practical training course will allow you to meet people within the beauty industry. There may be people there who know something you don?t and vice versa; having contacts within your chosen industry will benefit you in your career progression.\n<h3><strong>Save money</strong></h3>\nStudying a course that includes practical training will reduce your outgoing costs. Instead of having to purchase two separate components, Open Study College provides multiple courses that include the practical training days.\n\nSome of our most popular courses include...\n<ul>\n 	<li><a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/into-professional-and-special-occasion-make-up.html\">Introduction to Professional and Special Occasion Make-up with Practical Training </a></li>\n 	<li><a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/lash-and-brow-design-practical.html\">Lash and Eyebrow Design with Practical Training</a></li>\n 	<li><a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/make-up-artist-with-practical-training.html\">Make-up Artist with Practical Training </a></li>\n 	<li><a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/microdermabrasion-with-practical-training.html\">Microdermabrasion with Practical Training</a></li>\n</ul>\n...but we have a wide selection of courses to suit everyone.

When you enrol with us, you will receive\n<ul>\n 	<li>Award-winning tutor support</li>\n 	<li>The choice to study online or via a course pack</li>\n 	<li>A professional and friendly Student Support team</li>\n 	<li>A choice of over 450 courses to choose from</li>\n 	<li>Accredited qualifications such as CACHE, AAT and Active IQ</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>PLUS,</strong> as a handy perk, you will also receive a <strong>FREE</strong> NUS Extra card to use for the duration of your course.\n\nSo at least one part is sorted.

Harry was 11 years old when he was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour but did everything he could to help others in similar situations, and encourage others to join his journey to do the same.\n\nIt?s the familiar beaded bracelets that Harry created to raise money that the charity is well-known for. Identified as ?unique bracelets hand made with love for all people with cancer?, Open Study College wears these with pride and continues to promote all the hard work that Help Harry Help Others does.\n\nGeorgie Moseley, Harry\'s mother, continues to run the charity and push forward its initiative.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Great to stop by and see our charity supporter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OpenStudyColl?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@OpenStudyColl</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/popupshop?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#popupshop</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bullring?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Bullring</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/StudyYourWay?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#StudyYourWay</a> here until 18th Feb so if your interested in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DistanceLearning?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DistanceLearning</a>  do drop by <a href=\"https://t.co/496DRvlVZL\">pic.twitter.com/496DRvlVZL</a></p>&mdash; harry&#39;s mom #HHHO (@harry_moseley) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/harry_moseley/status/961615002699431936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 8, 2018</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<a href=\"http://hhho.org.uk/\" class=\"blog-cta\">Find out how you can get involved in this fantastic charity</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2018-02-09 11:07:18','2018-02-09 11:07:18',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/8112-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

	(1590,'Our Top Interview Tips That Employers Will Love','interview-tips-employers-love',NULL,NULL,'Everyone has had or will have an interview at some point in their life. Therefore, everyone has needed or will need some interview tips, too.\n\nThere are often myths flying around about certain things to do or what not to do in an interview. Some say dress formal, others say don?t. Some say ask about salary, and others don?t. It?s hard to know what to believe.\n\nBut we at <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/\">Open Study College</a> have been in this industry for a long time; we know what we are doing.\n\nMany of our students progress onto successful careers thanks to our amazing courses and great advice. So now it?s time to pass it onto you. Here are some of our top interview tips that we <em>know</em> employers will love:\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Arrive early</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nThis is a given. Arriving early ensures you can find the venue in time and shows that you are serious and passionate about the role.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Dress appropriately</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nThis is dependent on the type of industry you work in. If you are interviewing for a job in an office or managerial role, then dressing smartly is appropriate. However, for those working in the fashion industry or the arts, it may make more of an impression to dress fashionably ? but still respectfully.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Research the company and the role</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nHaving some background information on the company shows passion and initiative ? qualities that all employers look for in their candidates.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Have some questions prepared</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nAn interview is a two-way street; you are finding out whether you want to work there as much as they are doing the same for you. Have some questions prepared, such as ?what is your favourite thing about working here?? ? or ?will I find out whether I am successful either way?? ? this shows you are engaging in the interview.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Present positive body language</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nFirst impressions and body language make a big difference. If you sit arms crossed and slouching, this shows disinterest. Look your interviewer(s) in the eye, sit up straight and look engaged.

Therefore, everyone has or will need some interview tips, too.\n\nThere are often myths flying around about certain things to do or what not to do in an interview. Some say dress formal, others say don?t. Some say ask about salary, and others don?t. It?s hard to know what to believe.\n\nBut we at <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/\">Open Study College</a> have been in this industry for a long time; we know what we are doing.\n\nMany of our students progress onto successful careers thanks to our amazing courses and great advice. So now it?s time to pass it onto you. Here are some of our top interview tips that we <em>know</em> employers will love:\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Arrive early</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nThis is a given. Arriving early ensures you can find the venue in time and shows that you are serious and passionate about the role.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Dress appropriately</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nThis is dependent on the type of industry you work in. If you are interviewing for a job in an office or managerial role, then dressing smartly is appropriate. However, for those working in the fashion industry or the arts, it may make more of an impression to dress fashionably ? but still respectfully.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Research the company and the role</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nHaving some background information on the company show passion and initiative ? qualities that all employers look for in their candidates.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Have some questions prepared</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nAn interview is a two-way street; you are finding out whether you want to work there as much as they are doing the same for you. Have some questions prepared, such as ?what is your favourite thing about working here?? ? or ?will I find out either way about whether I am successful?? ? this shows you are engaging in the interview.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Present positive body language</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nFirst impressions and body language make a big difference. If you sit arms crossed and slouching, this shows disinterest. Look your interviewer(s) in the eye, sit up straight and look engage. It will win you some brownie points.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Stay Calm</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nNerves will take over and this may ruin your interview. Try to remain calm. Interviewers respect confidence (not arrogance) and the interview will seem to go quicker if you are less worried.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2>Remember that you are a perfect candidate</h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nYou have made it to the interview stage; this means that they already think you are great.

These signs are assigned by year of birth and determine your character and yearly fortune.\n\nJust like how the zodiac signs reflect character, there is also a learning style within education associated to each person.\n\nSince it is its year, let?s use the word dog as an example:\n<h5>When you see the word ?dog?, what is the first thing that happens?

This type of media sticks in their mind and helps them to remember things more clearly. They are often very organised and use colours to keep track of things.\n<h4>2 = Aural learner</h4>\nSounds and music are vital to the learning habits of aural learners. Hearing things clarifies what they are learning and they often find themselves repeating things to themselves and using mnemonic devices.\n<h4>3 = Kinesthetic learner</h4>\nAlso known as physical learners, they are very hands on and tactile. In order to understand things, many kinesthetic learners need tangible representations of things to learn for themselves.\n<h4>4 = Verbal learner</h4>\nVerbal learners can often get confused with aural learners; these types of learners are most comfortable with words via speech and writing. Often these types of learners find listening to audio tapes and then rewriting them in their own words is the best method of study.\n<h4>5 = Solitary learner</h4>\nA solitary learner is someone who prefers to learn by themselves. Focusing on the work and the end result without any distractions is their main goal.\n<h4>6= Social learner</h4>\nFriends, friends and more friends! These types of learners work best with others. Collaborating and using other people?s ideas allows their minds to work best and excel.\n<h4>7 = Logical learner</h4>\nThis type of learner prefers to use logic, reasoning and systems in order to learn and come to a result. They can often be called Mathematical learners as they take steps in working out an answer just like equations.\n\nThis is just an example; of course we won\'t be able to identify your learning style from one question, but this is so you can get the gist of what we mean.\n\nAlthough these are the main types of learning categories, you can often have crossovers as no one is ever straight forward with their learning.\n\nTake the time to find out which type of learner you are as it will help you to learn more effectively and efficiently.

And with distance learning, you are in control so time is not an issue.\n\nSo in that case, why not try Japanese?? As an underrated language, we want to change this and get more people speaking it.\n\nHere?s 4 reasons why we think you should learn Japanese.\n<h2><strong>Improves brain functions and activity </strong></h2>\nOf all languages, Japanese is one of the hardest to learn. Having said that, you also stand to gain the most from learning Japanese.\n\nWhen your brain is challenged and has to cope with something more difficult than it is used to, it improves its functions. Studying Japanese will not only make it easier for you to learn other languages in the future, it will make learning in general that little bit simpler.\n<h2><strong>Travel and culture opportunities </strong></h2>\nEast Asia is a popular tourism destination for travellers. Whether you want to get up close and personal with the Komodo dragons, or see the Chocolate Hills in Bohol, it has a lot to offer. Speaking and understanding one of the most popular languages in East Asia will help you make the most of your travels.\n\nYou will be able to speak to the locals, ask for directions and understand what is going on around you; your travels will be so much better!\n<h2><strong>Individualism </strong></h2>\nHow many people do you know who know Japanese? not many, right?\n\nThat?s because Japanese is a very unique and different language. Having the ability to speak this language will make you stand out from the crowd.\n<h2><strong>Boost your CV </strong></h2>\nSpeaking another language is like gold dust on CVs. Many employers look for this as it shows commitment to learning as well as benefits for the company. If a company has overseas communications, then it will need to hire someone who can work internationally for them.\n\nSo you know what this means? free (business) holidays!\n\nDoes this sound like something you?re interested in?

Have you made any changes for the better?\n\nDon?t worry, we?ve all been there? (and if we go on technicalities, February is 3 days shorter than most months, so we?ve been deprived of some time!)\n\nIt is hard to get some things done if you?re not naturally an organised person. But that?s not to say that it isn?t possible to become more organised.\n\nHere are some of our best tips on how to become more organised:\n<h2><strong>Make lists and write things down</strong></h2>\nMaking lists and writing things down gives your plans and responsibilities a sense of urgency. No longer are they just a passing thought in your mind that will be overtaken with videos of a cat playing a piano; writing things down makes them permanent, and a constant reminder that they need to be done.\n<ul>\n 	<li>Try to write things in order of importance</li>\n 	<li>Write everything you are likely to forget down, i.e. shopping lists, birthdays, work schedule?</li>\n 	<li>Put the list somewhere you will remember, e.g. on the fridge, in your smartphone?s</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Ask for help </strong></h2>\nYou can?t always do everything for yourself. Sometimes you need the help of others but just don?t realise it. This can put more strain on yourself and make it seem as if you have a lot more to do than you think.\n\nAsk for help when you need it. It will relieve your workload and allow you more time to focus on the things that are solely your responsibility.\n<h2><strong>Have a regular clear out </strong></h2>\nHave you heard the expression ?tidy house, tidy mind?...?\n\nWell this is absolutely true.\n\nSurrounding yourself with a messy environment puts pressure on our mind and makes us think that there is a lot more to do than what there actually is. Those who live and work in a messy environment are said to be more likely to develop depression and anxiety, and be less organised than those who are neater.\n<ul>\n 	<li>Clear out your house regularly</li>\n 	<li>Ensure everything has a place ? if it doesn?t, toss it!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Reward yourself</strong></h2>\nIf you have something to look forward to after completing your responsibilities, you are more likely to want to do them.\n\nReward yourself with little things; small enough that they won?t break the bank, but nice enough that you feel like you deserve it.\n<h2><strong>Make schedules and plans </strong></h2>\nSchedules help us to manage our time more effectively and become more organised. If you create a schedule that includes your average day-to-day plans, you are more likely to stick to it. Include everything from work and the gym, to food breaks and social plans; you?ll suddenly find you have a lot more time than you originally thought.\n\nTime that you could spend studying a distance learning course with Open Study College, for example?\n\nTake a look at our courses (that are currently on discount by the way!) and see if there is something that is perfect for you.\n\n<a class=\"blog-cta\" href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/pages/how-it-works.html\">Check out our courses</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2018-02-28 09:49:29','2018-02-28 09:49:29',2,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/?p=8211',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

Samantha takes over the role from her father, Mark Rutter, who is stepping down as CEO to become Chairman of Open Study College. Samantha has a wealth of experience having founded the company with Mark in 2007 and has previously occupied the role of COO at the college.\n\nBeing International Women?s Day, the achievements of women are being celebrated around the world, making today the perfect day to announce the change in leadership structure. International Women?s Day has been celebrated since the days of the Suffragettes in the early 1900?s. Fast forward to 2018 and gender parity is still an issue more than a century later. Currently women take up around a quarter of boardrooms in the UK, so when a strong businesswoman such as Samantha is appointed as CEO, it feels like the entire female population take a collective step closer to gender equality.\n\nSamantha Rutter is a brilliant example of an inspirational business person who champions women in business and the important role they have to play. And with more than 50% of the college?s workforce being female, she is keen for her business to embrace gender equality.\n\nWe interviewed Samantha to find out more about her working life.\n<h2><strong>What made you decide to work in the distance learning industry?</strong></h2>\nIt wasn?t my original choice to be honest, I actually studied Law, but decided it wasn?t for me. My family had been in the distance learning industry for many years, and it was a natural direction for me to take. I started the company with my father 10 years ago and have worked my way up so I know every aspect of the business, which I believe is key when you?re going to run a business. It?s difficult to advise someone of the best way to carry out a role when you?ve never done it yourself.\n<h2><strong>Now that you?re in your new role, what will you be focussing on?</strong></h2>\nPrimarily, I?ll be focusing on ensuring the success of the Company continues. This involves overseeing the operations of the Company and ensuring our plans are implemented. I?ll also be looking at our Company structure and management teams to ensure all are helping to drive the business further forward.\n<h2><strong>You?ve received a lot of recognition for your work in the last year, how does it feel to receive accolades such as ?Business Person of the Year??</strong></h2>\nIt was a great honour to receive all the awards last year; not only for myself but for Open Study College also. We achieved 9 awards last year which was a very pleasant surprise ? we?re aiming for 10 this year! My personal awards were the highlight of my year; it?s great to be recognised as an individual.\n<h2><strong>What challenges do you feel women face in the work place? And, how can they overcome these challenges?</strong></h2>\nWell I know for me personally, sometimes when I walk into a meeting they firstly don?t expect me to be a woman (Sam Rutter), and secondly, they are more surprised by my age as I?m quite young to be in the role that I have.\n\nI think if you work hard then you can overcome any gender barrier. Obviously, there are some companies who are still not female-friendly in this day and age, but would you even want to work there anyway? I?m lucky at Open Study College as we are a very female-friendly work place, and actually have a higher ratio of female to male employees. But my advice would be to go for what you want and don?t let anyone stand in your way.\n<h2><strong>As a female CEO, you are a fantastic role model for young women in business. What advice would you give to inspire them to succeed in the world of business?</strong></h2>\nI say that if you want something ? go for it. No way did I think I would reach CEO of the Company when we started 10 years ago ? and I certainly didn?t expect all of this before reaching 30! My school years weren?t that successful, and I had to work extra hard to make the grades to get on to my Law course. It really does show that with determination and perseverance you really can do anything.\n<h2><strong>And finally, who are your female role models?</strong></h2>\nKarren Brady is someone I really look up to. She started her professional career very young at the age of 23 and took the Business world by storm, even in the heavily male dominated world of football. I don?t know how she has enough hours in the day to fit it all in, but she does it exceptionally well.\n\nI would also say the women of my family are all amazing role models to me. The last 3 generations of women have been (and still are) very hardworking ? some even holding down 2-3 jobs at any one time whilst having young families!',NULL,NULL,9,'2018-03-08 16:44:47','2018-03-08 16:45:31',2,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/?p=8260',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

Currently women take up around a quarter of boardrooms in the UK, so when a strong businesswoman such as Samantha is appointed as CEO, it feels like the entire female population take a collective step closer to gender equality.\n\nSamantha Rutter is a brilliant example of an inspirational business person who champions women in business and the important role they have to play. And with more than 50% of the college?s workforce being female, she is keen for her business to embrace gender equality.\n\nWe interviewed Samantha to find out more about her working life.\n<h2><strong>What made you decide to work in the distance learning industry?</strong></h2>\nIt wasn?t my original choice to be honest, I actually studied Law, but decided it wasn?t for me. My family had been in the distance learning industry for many years, and it was a natural direction for me to take. I started the company with my father 10 years ago and have worked my way up so I know every aspect of the business, which I believe is key when you?re going to run a business. It?s difficult to advise someone of the best way to carry out a role when you?ve never done it yourself.\n<h2><strong>Now that you?re in your new role, what will you be focussing on?</strong></h2>\nPrimarily, I?ll be focusing on ensuring the success of the Company continues. This involves overseeing the operations of the Company and ensuring our plans are implemented. I?ll also be looking at our Company structure and management teams to ensure all are helping to drive the business further forward.\n<h2><strong>You?ve received a lot of recognition for your work in the last year, how does it feel to receive accolades such as ?Business Person of the Year??</strong></h2>\nIt was a great honour to receive all the awards last year; not only for myself but for Open Study College also. We achieved 9 awards last year which was a very pleasant surprise ? we?re aiming for 10 this year! My personal awards were the highlight of my year; it?s great to be recognised as an individual.\n<h2><strong>What challenges do you feel women face in the work place? And, how can they overcome these challenges?</strong></h2>\nWell I know for me personally, sometimes when I walk into a meeting they firstly don?t expect me to be a woman (Sam Rutter), and secondly, they are more surprised by my age as I?m quite young to be in the role that I have.\n\nI think if you work hard then you can overcome any gender barrier. Obviously, there are some companies who are still not female-friendly in this day and age, but would you even want to work there anyway? I?m lucky at Open Study College as we are a very female-friendly work place, and actually have a higher ratio of female to male employees. But my advice would be to go for what you want and don?t let anyone stand in your way.\n<h2><strong>As a female CEO, you are a fantastic role model for young women in business. What advice would you give to inspire them to succeed in the world of business?</strong></h2>\nI say that if you want something ? go for it. No way did I think I would reach CEO of the Company when we started 10 years ago ? and I certainly didn?t expect all of this before reaching 30! My school years weren?t that successful, and I had to work extra hard to make the grades to get on to my Law course. It really does show that with determination and perseverance you really can do anything.\n<h2><strong>And finally, who are your female role models?</strong></h2>\nKarren Brady is someone I really look up to. She started her professional career very young at the age of 23 and took the Business world by storm, even in the heavily male dominated world of football. I don?t know how she has enough hours in the day to fit it all in, but she does it exceptionally well.\n\nI would also say the women of my family are all amazing role models to me. The last 3 generations of women have been (and still are) very hardworking ? some even holding down 2-3 jobs at any one time whilst having young families!',NULL,NULL,9,'2018-03-08 16:40:48','2018-03-08 16:40:48',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/8260-revision-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

You need to show that you are <em>better</em> than anyone else that can also do your job.\n\nYour CV is the key. This is the first impression that employers will have, so you need to ensure that it?s a great one.\n\nAmongst other things, distance learning can help boost your CV and help you to stand out from the crowd.\n<h2><strong>Post-Graduate or Extra-Curricular Learning</strong></h2>\nStudying after university or in your spare time to improve your career shows a passion for your industry. It reveals that it\'s not just a way to make money, but your hobby and what you want to do with your life. Those who enjoy what they do are usually the ones who do it the best!\n<h2><strong>Accredited Qualifications</strong></h2>\nNot only are our courses bench-marked to ensure they provide the required knowledge that employers desire, some are also accredited by internationally-known organisations. Such as <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/qualifications/cache\">CACHE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/qualifications/aat\">AAT</a> and <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/qualifications/active-iq\">Active IQ</a> just to name a few. Adding these to your CV puts you ahead of your competition and prove that you know what you are doing.\n<h2><strong>Work Experience</strong></h2>\nEmployers appreciate those who use their initiative to occupy their time with activities that are beneficial to their career.  Rather than simply lounging around, you are making strides to better yourself.

	(1723,'Our 10 Top Tips for Exam Success','top-tips-exam-success',NULL,NULL,'We?ve all been there?\n\n?we all know how stressful exams can be and how anxious we can get on the day.\n\nNo amount of preparation and revision seems to do the trick; the more stressed you get, the more anxious you get and then? well, let?s not think about that.\n\nWhat we need to do is think of how to overcome this stress and anxiety.\n\nLuckily, we?ve got some top tips to help you get passed all of this and work your way towards exam success:\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Organise your space</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nEver heard the phrase <em>?Tidy house, tidy mind?</em>? Well this is 100% true!\n\nYour brain sees a messy environment as a distraction and something else to focus on. If you clear your surroundings you clear your mind and can focus on your studying, which will lead to exam success.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Make a detailed plan</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nA study plan is how you can ensure that you fit in everything you need before each exam. Prioritise your exam revision in chronological order but also consider how much time you need to spend on each topic. Your ability for each topic may not be equally spread.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Use your tutor to their full extent </strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nYour tutor is there to help so make sure you ask any questions well in advance of the exam. No question is a stupid question.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Practice with old exam papers</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nA lot of the time, examinations have the same concept, but questions are presented in a different manner. Practicing with past papers will allow you to get familiar with the format, as well as identify your weaker areas.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Break down your answers</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nWhen you reach an answer, speak the method out loud. This way you will be able to get to grips with how you got there and understand how to achieve it again in the future.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Figure out how you learn best </strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nThere are 3 main types of learners: Audio, visual and kinesthetic learners. As their names suggest, each learner learns best in different ways, so it is important you know which you are to ensure you are being the most effective with your studying.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Don?t overwork yourself </strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nThis is vital! Overworking can lead to stress and your brain will start focusing on the stress rather than the revision itself. Use your study plan to schedule in well-deserved breaks and give yourself time to relax and recover.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Eat a healthy diet </strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nAs well as a great life tip, this is a great tip for exam success. Certain foods boost memory and concentration, and are better for brain activity. Foods like salmon, blueberries, dark chocolate and nuts will keep your brain healthy and active. Not all together of course?

	(1725,'Our 10 Top Tips for Exam Success','8384-revision-v1',NULL,NULL,'We?ve all been there?\n\n?we all know how stressful exams can be and how anxious we can get on the day.\n\nNo amount of preparation and revision seems to do the trick; the more stressed you get, the more anxious you get and then? well, let?s not think about that.\n\nWhat we need to think of is how to overcome this stress and anxiety.\n\nLuckily, we?ve got some top tips to help you get passed all of this and work your way towards exam success:\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Organise your space</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nEver heard the phrase <em>?Tidy house, tidy mind?</em>? Well this is 100% true!\n\nYour brain sees a messy environment as a distraction and something else to focus on. If you clear your surroundings you clear your mind and can focus on your studying, which will lead to exam success.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Make a detailed plan</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nA study plan is how you can ensure that you fit in everything you need before each exam. Prioritise your exams in chronological order but also consider how much time you need to spend on each topic. Your ability for each topic may not be equally spread.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Use your tutor to their full extent </strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nYour tutor is there to help so make sure ask any questions you need in well in advance of the exam. No question is a stupid question.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Practice with old exam papers</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nA lot of the time, examinations have the same concept, but questions are presented in a different manner. Practicing with past papers will allow you to get familiar with the format, as well as identify your weaker areas.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Break down your answers</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nWhen you reach an answer, speak the method out loud. This way you will be able to get to grips with how you got there and understand how to achieve it again in the future.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Figure out how you learn best </strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nThere are 3 main types of learners: Audio, visual and kinesthetic learners. As their names suggest, each learner learns best in different ways, so it is important you know which you are to ensure you are being the most effective with your studying.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Don?t overwork yourself </strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nThis is vital! Overworking can lead to stress and your brain will start focusing on the stress rather than the revision itself. Use your study plan to schedule in well-deserved breaks and give yourself time to relax and recover.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Eat a healthy diet </strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nAs well as a great life tip, this is a great tip for exam success. Certain foods are better for brain activity and boost memory and concentration. Foods like salmon, blueberries, dark chocolate and nuts will keep your brain healthy and active. Not all together of course? (unless that?s your thing.)\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Get plenty of sleep </strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nThere is no point staying up late to cram in some last-minute revision. Without sleep your brain activity decreases and you are not as productive as you would usually be. Schedule your sleep (and even naps if you need to!) into your study plan to ensure get enough.\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h2><strong>Be prepared on the day</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\nEnsure you have a healthy breakfast and prepare everything you need for the day of the exam.

So another language should be a doddle.\n\nIn that case, why not learn Spanish?\n\nHere?s 4 reasons why we think you should learn Spanish.\n<h2><strong>Improves brain functions and activity </strong></h2>\nWhen your brain is challenged and has to cope with something more difficult than it is used to, it improves its functions. Learning Spanish will not only make it easier for you to learn other languages in the future, it will make learning in general that little bit simpler.\n\nIn addition, Spanish is one of the best languages to start with if you have never learnt a new language before, as there are\n<h2><strong>Travel and culture opportunities </strong></h2>\nThere are many countries all over the world that speak Spanish.\n\nSpain?Peru?Dominican Republic?Mexico?Cuba? the list could go on.\n\nWhether you want to get up close and personal with sea turtles in the Galapagos Islands, or see the Sagrada Família in Barcelona, learning Spanish could help you get there. Speaking and understanding one of the most popular languages in the world will help you make the most of your travels.\n\nYou will be able to speak to the locals, ask for directions and understand what is going on around you; your travels will be so much better!\n<h2><strong>Career possibilites</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Spanish teacher</li>\n 	<li>Translator</li>\n 	<li>TEFL teacher</li>\n</ul>\n?these are just a few of the most popular job roles that people who learn Spanish take on. But if you think about it, you could do any job you wanted? but do it in a Spanish-speaking country!\n\nHow amazing would it be to work abroad? Experiencing a new culture, new experiences while getting paid!\n<h2><strong>Boost your CV </strong></h2>\nSpeaking another language is like gold dust on CVs. Many employers look for this as it shows commitment to learning as well as benefits for the company. If a company has overseas communications, then it will need to hire someone who can work internationally for them.\n\nSo you know what this means? free (business) holidays!\n\nDoes this sound like something you?re interested in?

Some focus on marine animals, some focus on plant life, and others may choose to specialise in habitats and activities.\n\nDepending on their chosen area of study, then can work hands on in the field, diving underwater to examine further. Or they may choose to work more behind the scenes in laboratories conducting experiments and observations.\n<h2><strong>Why become a marine biologist?</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Love animals, particularly marine animals?</li>\n 	<li>Great at and enjoy swimming?</li>\n 	<li>Not afraid to get your hands dirty?</li>\n</ul>\nThen becoming a marine biologist could be the perfect career choice for you.\n<h2><strong>How do you become a marine biologist?</strong></h2>\nLike many scientific careers, there is a very full journey of studying and qualifications that need to take place before you can become a marine biologist.\n\nLuckily for you, Open Study College can kick-start your career and help you on your way.\n\nFirst, you must study <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/qualifications/igcse\"><strong><u>GCSEs/iGCSEs</u></strong></a>.\n\nThese start the foundation of your learning, and it is necessary to have them in subjects such as <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/igcse-biology.html\"><strong><u>Biology</u></strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/igcse-physics.html\"><strong><u>Physics</u></strong></a> or <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/igcse-chemistry.html\"><strong><u>Chemistry</u></strong></a>.\n\nThen, you move onto<a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/qualifications/a-level\"> <strong><u>A Levels</u></strong></a>.\n\nThese will build on what you have learnt at GCSE level and allow you to focus your knowledge.

Some focus on marine animals, some focus on plant life, and others may choose to specialise in habitats and activities.\n\nDepending on their chosen area of study, then can work hands on in the field, diving underwater to examine further. Or they may choose to work more behind the scenes in laboratories conducting experiments and observations.\n<h2><strong>Why become a marine biologist?</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Love animals, particularly marine animals?</li>\n 	<li>Great at and enjoy swimming?</li>\n 	<li>Not afraid to get your hands dirty?</li>\n</ul>\nThen becoming a marine biologist could be the perfect career choice for you.\n<h2><strong>How do you become a marine biologist?</strong></h2>\nLike many scientific careers, there is a very full journey of studying and qualifications that need to take place before you can become a marine biologist.\n\nLuckily for you, Open Study College can kick-start your career and help you on your way.\n\nFirst, you must study <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/qualifications/igcse\"><strong><u>GCSEs/iGCSEs</u></strong></a>.\n\nThese start the foundation of your learning, and it is necessary to have them in subjects such as <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/igcse-biology.html\"><strong><u>Biology</u></strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/igcse-physics.html\"><strong><u>Physics</u></strong></a> or <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/igcse-chemistry.html\"><strong><u>Chemistry</u></strong></a>.\n\nThen, you move onto<a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/qualifications/a-level\"> <strong><u>A Levels</u></strong></a>.\n\nThese will build on what you have learnt at GCSE level and allow you to focus your knowledge.

	(1885,'Why Female Entrepreneurship Means Global Success','8625-autosave-v1',NULL,NULL,'For many years gone by, women have been fighting for their place within the male-dominant workforce.\n\nNot only does equality promote confidence and self-worth amongst women, it allows the global economy to succeed and opens more opportunities for future generations. As a society, we all thrive when we <em>all</em> thrive ? meaning having equal amounts of female to male success is not a threat or hinderance; it is a benefit to us all.\n\nTake America as an example. Only 30 percent of successful businesses in America are owned by women, whereas the entire world population of women in 2017 was 48 percent.  If this female population were given equal opportunities, the world would profit as a whole. More successful businesses mean more workplace vacancies and lowers the unemployment rate. A lower unemployment rate means a higher economic contribution resulting in a larger distribution communities. The only plausible way to do this is to provide women with equal opportunities for success.\n\nThe AI Awards reflect this attitude in their Influential Businesswoman Awards campaign. They believe that ?gender equality is the only solution for a sustainable economy? and, as such, are praising women in significant or influential positions for their contribution to society. Difficulties that women face in the workplace are used to ?[promote] and [encourage] women to take part in entrepreneurial endeavours.?\n\nThis is why we are proud to announce that our CEO, Samantha Rutter, has been awarded the Most Influential Woman in e-Learning at the 2018 AI Influential Businesswoman Awards.\n\nAs one of the 1.5 million women in the UK who are self-employed, this global accolade allows Samantha to fuel other women into achieving more and celebrating all successes.\n\nAt Open Study College, this is the ethos that we aim to deliver. By providing recognised qualifications and courses through distance learning, we allow our students to achieve their full potential and break down the barriers restricting their success.\n\nWith 78% of our students being women, the importance of this win is even more significant. Often finances, lack of training opportunities, personal commitments or lack of confidence can hinder female progression, but our objective is to provide them with the tools to pave their own way.\n\nYou can find the full details about this campaign and more on the <a href=\"https://www.acq-intl.com/2018-the-2018-influential-businesswoman-awards-press-release\"><u>AI website</u></a>.',NULL,NULL,9,'2018-07-06 13:01:19','2018-07-06 13:01:19',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/8625-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

I love the jobs and roles I have, but this is most certainly not the career I initially intended for myself! However, it just shows, you don?t always need a clear path from the beginning. There is always time to do what you love, even if that means re-training.\n\nAt 16 years old, I left school education and started a job as a typist. This was a pretty standard role at the time, so I was pleased to have it. A year later at 17, I moved out of my family home and set up a home with my boyfriend who, after 2 years, then became my husband. Our first few years of marriage were focused on building a home and family together, so I wasn?t concerned about my career and happy with the role I had. However, after 5 years, I got what you may call itchy-feet and started to want more from my career, so applied for a job as a secretary. This position was a step up the ladder and an increase in pay, so it was definitely a confidence boost to be offered the position!\n\nThis didn?t last long, however. After 12 months of working as a secretary, I transferred into running a business with my husband in plumbing and heating. Although I did some of the strenuous work or heavy lifting, I was more involved in the office with admin work, as this was a big part of my career history. (Plus I did dabble as a plumber?s mate from time to time!)\n\nThe next stage of our lives was the foundation of my current career success. After having my son at 25, I was home-bound and restricted to what I could do within the plumbing business. But an idea came to me when looking at our accounts ? why pay someone else to do them (who wasn?t particularly reliable to be honest) when I could just do them myself? So I did.\n\n<a href=\"/storage/images/media_items/old_images/2018/07/AAT.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-8684 aligncenter\" src=\"/storage/images/media_items/old_images/2018/07/AAT-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Teresa Clarke: More than just a tutor\" width=\"377\" height=\"251\" /></a>\n\nAfter doing some research, I started with an A Level in Accounting as I wasn?t sure whether I was clever enough to study. I gained a B in that so then moved onto studying Level 3 and Level 4 Accounting via distance learning. It was operated much differently then. Any contact I had with my tutor was via post ? yes, I am that old! But I loved it as I was able to work around my duties as a mother. Sometimes I even managed to incorporate the two by reading him bedtime stories about accounting. I?m not sure whether he actually enjoyed them or whether he just fell asleep due to boredom... but it did the job!\n\nThe period after my studies was a busy time. I took on some volunteer work as a treasurer for a local charity. This worked well for me as, again, my son could accompany me, and I was able to work it all around the plumbing business, too.\n\nIn 1998, I gained my AAT Practice Licence and began to work for a few local self-employed people, gaining clients from contacts and word-of-mouth. I ran this practice alongside the plumbing business, but we also thought it a good idea to start another business in Property and Sales. So, Monday to Friday I was working on site and as an accountant on the weekend ? as well as being a mother first and foremost.\n\nBy 2000, I was an accountant, running a plumbing business, a property renovation business and, in addition, we also started a property management business, too. We didn?t do things by halves! The credit crunch hit around 2007 and that?s when the opportunity to teach then presented itself, so I thought? why not?\n\nI gained my PTTLS Teaching Qualification in 2012 and eased myself in with some supply teaching before securing 2 part-time roles ? the first teaching accountancy in a local Adult Learning Centre, and the second teaching functional skills maths in a local prison. So I could add tutor to my other list of occupations.\n\nCurrently, however, my role is Partner in Clarke Accountancy alongside my son who is also a qualified accountant. (I guess those bed time stories worked better than I thought!) In addition, I am a published and aspiring author under the penname Reesa Trelack. I always wanted to write, so I did.  I still love teaching, though, which is why I enjoy my role as a tutor at Open Study College.\n\nMy reasons for doing anything and everything are that we only have one life; it is too short doing something you don?t enjoy doing.

Well done! Or perhaps you?re returning to education to further your knowledge and enhance your career. In both circumstances you will need to know how to pick the perfect A Level for you and your career.\n\nThis may seem like an important choice you have to make at the moment, but it\'s also important to keep a sense of perspective. It is possible to change your mind after all, and A Levels are not the only possible options. There are lots of different routes to get to a future career.\n<h3>Base it on your interests</h3>\nPerhaps choosing your A Levels is fairly straightforward for you; maybe you already know your own strengths and the subjects you like. If this is so, then you can congratulate yourself on having the personal insight to know what you are good at and what you like doing. Personal enthusiasm and interest in a subject are really important for successful study, and if you come out with good A Levels grades, you can then decide whether or not you want to do a degree, a degree apprenticeship, an apprenticeship or vocational education, or perhaps even enter the world of work.\n\nBut if this <em>isn\'t</em> you, then it\'s time to collate your thinking about A Levels with future career possibilities (even if this sounds scary to begin with).

You don?t have to make any firm decisions just yet, but instead you could come up with a career ?feature\' which you know is important to you. For example, perhaps working with people, working with numbers or working creatively are ?career features? which appeal. In which case, make sure you take appropriate A Levels for what you see yourself doing, even if you don?t have a job title just yet.\n\nAnd how do you find your personal career features, I hear you ask?

For example, have you always been the kind of child who makes jokes and enjoys being the centre of attention? In which case, working with people and being creative may be your career features. This would then lead you to consider a range of career options within the media, entertainment or creative industries ? and even if you don?t yet have a single job title, you can still start to plan your A Levels accordingly.\n\nGood luck, and don\'t forget to check all the flexible education options available to you from <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Open Study College</span></a>!',NULL,NULL,9,'2018-08-10 12:21:11','2018-08-10 12:21:11',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/?p=8743',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

Covey</p>\n</blockquote>\nGreat customer service is something that can be taught and learned; if employees receive respect and are treated in a way that pleases them from higher level management and their peers, they are more likely to replicate this in how they talk to customers.\n\nYes, it is your employees? job to provide excellent customer service regardless of how they are treated, but this will be a lot easier if they are in a positive environment that they trust and value working in. Not only does this result in a better and more productive workforce, it translates into a better customer service journey:\n<ol>\n 	<li>Employers provide a warm environment with respect and trust?</li>\n 	<li>Employees feel valued, enjoy their job and put more effort into their role?</li>\n 	<li>Strong relationships with customers are built?</li>\n 	<li>Customers receive a great customer service journey?</li>\n 	<li>Customers are more likely to return and recommend the business due to the positive experience they received.</li>\n</ol>\nThe importance of consistency in creating trustworthy and reliable customer journeys stretches back to a brand or company itself.\n\nTake Open Study College for example; a distance learning business with customers of all ages, backgrounds and intentions at its heart. A business like ours is founded on the intention of providing accessible education to those who need it. So, it would be a paradox to have a business aimed towards customers but then not following through by providing the best possible customer journey experience.\n\nThis ethos runs throughout the business from the top. Respectful and appreciative employers who value the team, and a hard-working team with an <em>?open, honest and responsive philosophy [that] features key ingredients required for exceptional customer service.?</em>\n\nThat?s why we believe we have recently been awarded Silver Stevie Winner for Customer Service in the 2018 International Business Awards.

If this is so, then you can congratulate yourself on having the personal insight to know what you are good at and how to make decisions that are best for you. Personal enthusiasm and interest in a subject are really important for successful study, and if you come out with good A Levels grades, you can then decide whether or not you want to do a degree, a degree apprenticeship, an apprenticeship or vocational education, or perhaps even enter the world of work.\n\nBut if this <em>isn\'t</em> you, then it\'s time to collate your thinking about A Levels with future career possibilities (even if this sounds scary to begin with). So, this is where the sense of perspective comes in: you will need to do some careful thinking about where you see yourself and what you really enjoy doing. But this shouldn\'t cause you unnecessary stress.  Even if you don\'t get it right first time, you still have options, such as changing your A Level choices once you\'ve started the new academic year, or selecting to study a new subject through distance learning.\n<h2><strong>Choosing a career</strong></h2>\nIf you have your heart set on a particular career, then now is the time to do some research about the degree you would need to gain in order to get there.

It?s a very anxious time.\n\nWhichever bracket you fall into, you will still need to know what results day entails, and how to best be prepared for it.\n<h2><strong>Before Results Day</strong></h2>\n<h3>Relax.</h3>\nIt may be easier said than done, but stressing isn\'t going to change what grade you have. You?ve already sat the exams so there is nothing more you can do. <a href=\"https://blog.openstudycollege.com/enjoy-summer-results-day/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Enjoy the rest of your summer</span></a> and make the most of your free time.\n<h3>Have all the necessary information</h3>\nMost results days are held at your school or college, so it will be useful to know things such as what time it will be open or which entrance to use. However, if you study through distance learning, you may be receiving your results by email, in which case it is handy to know when and ensure that you have access to a computer at the time.\n<h3>Be prepared for all outcomes</h3>\nIt is best to be objective in situations like this. Don?t assume you are going to fail but be aware of the possibilities if this does happen. Are you going to go through Clearing? Are you going to take a year out? Or are you going to look at other options available? Have a clear idea of how you will approach this situation should it occur.\n<h2><strong>On Results Day</strong></h2>\n<h3>Stay calm.</h3>\nRegardless of what happens, stay calm. Like we said, there is nothing you can do to change the results. But there is always something you can do to change what happens after you receive your results.\n<h3>Don?t make any rash decisions.</h3>\nWhen students don?t receive the grades they want, they can panic and do the quickest thing possible that seems like a good idea. Luckily, if you follow our guide to results day, you will already be prepared and know the options available to you, so this shouldn?t be an issue.\n<h3>If you get your expected results?</h3>\n<strong>CONGRATULATIONS!</strong> All that hard work has paid off!\n\nIf you have studied GCSEs, then ensure your place at your college or sixth form is confirmed. Some places have entry requirements so it is best to make sure.\n\nIf you have done your A Levels and are planning to go to university, then check UCAS track as this will have confirmation of your place and the instructions on how to confirm.\n\nBut if you aren?t planning on going to university or study your A Levels, check out the other options available to you, such as distance learning courses, apprenticeships or work schemes.\n<h3>If you didn?t get your expected results?</h3>\nDon?t worry, there is always an option. For all you know, your study establishment may have still offered you a place, so you should still check to know what to do next.\n\nIf you are not offered a place, there are a few options available to you:\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Apply to university</strong><strong> through Clearing</strong> ? UCAS will match your grades with various university courses to find you a place.</li>\n 	<li><strong>Resit your exams and defer for a year</strong> ? it is okay to not progress immediately after school or college. Many people retake or have a gap year and attend the following year.</li>\n 	<li><strong>Consider other options</strong> ? university is not for everyone. There are other options available that will still allow you to start your dream career and get to where you want to be.</li>\n 	<li><strong>Apply for a BTEC course</strong> - sometimes these courses have lower acceptance grades and may be an option for you o</li>\n</ul>\nIf your results are better than expected?\n\n<strong>CONGRATULATIONS!</strong> All that hard work has paid off! If you are planning to go to university, check UCAS Track. This will have confirmation of your place and the instructions on how to confirm.\n\nHowever, you can also choose to apply through Adjustment and see if there are any places in other university or on different courses that these higher grades will allow you to apply to.\n<h2><strong>After Results Day</strong></h2>\n<h3>Enjoy yourself!</h3>\nAll the stress of results day is over and you can look forward to what is to come.

You have researched and chosen a specific course because you want to move into a specific career; this is inspiring. But then there are people like me ? I left school without a vision of what I wanted to do or which career path I wanted to take. Throughout my life I moved through various job roles, and it wasn?t until I experienced life-changing circumstances that allowed me to see what it was that I wanted to do.\n\nI was an average-class working mother with three children, living in Birmingham in an ex-council estate. We had two cars on the drive and was fortunate enough to be able to holiday to Europe each year; it was an ordinary but happy life. We lived to our means, but life was great and just getting comfortable.\n\nThen in 2007, our lives changed forever. A week before his 7<sup>th</sup> birthday, my son, Harry, was diagnosed with cancer; an inoperable brain tumour in the centre of his brain. Radiotherapy wasn?t an option due to his age, either, and so chemo was the only option of treatment.\n\nI gave up my career become Harry?s full-time carer. It wasn?t ideal, but I didn?t hesitate as I knew it was best for my son. As a mom it was very hard to watch, and I felt so helpless as I couldn?t fix him or patch him up like a parent should. All I could do was be by his side, which didn?t seem enough. But Harry was my inspiration throughout it all. He was so optimistic and never wallowed in his illness, even when we were told the tumour was still growing and the chemo had to be stopped.\n\nWhen Harry became a little older, we were keen to try all possible options and so he began radiotherapy. Little did I know that this would be a key change in my life. It wasn?t until Harry met Robert Harley, a 55-year-old businessman and fellow cancer patient, that I saw the true spirit of my son: Robert was losing his battle to the same illness that Harry had. Reluctant to let him go, Harry turned to me and said ?mom, if I was that poorly, you wouldn?t want people to not visit me because of how they?d feel? This is about Robert and I have to visit.? So young, yet so wise. Maybe the illness had made him more mature than his young years?\n\nHe was very quiet on the way home in the car until he finally piped up and said ?mom, I have to help get Robert and people like me better. Not enough is being done and I really have to help and raise money for research.? Always encouraging my kids to follow their dreams I replied, ?well, have a think of what you want to do and do it, Harry?.  Never did I imagine that what Harry was about to embark on would achieve so much.\n\n<a href=\"/storage/images/media_items/old_images/2018/09/hhho.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8797 aligncenter\" src=\"/storage/images/media_items/old_images/2018/09/hhho.png\" height=\"300\" width=\"208\" alt=\"Help Harry Help Others\" /></a>\n\nHelp Harry Help Others has had a large impact on the lives of cancer sufferers and their families but has had just as big of an effect on myself. Harry had an amazing outlook on life and rather than focus on the negatives in his life like being ill or the things his illness prevented him from doing, he focused on the positives of what he could do and didn?t let go of his goals, vision and dreams. Hard work and determination were key and that was all that he needed to make his vision a reality. His saying ?believe in yourself and make it happen? and ?I?m putting the CAN into cancer? will live with me always.\n\nHarry gave me the strength, reality check and self-belief to continue with his work. His journey with cancer and the impact it had on our family gave me the vision of how Harry?s work could continue,  hence why I became founder and CEO of the Help Harry Help Others charity.\n\nHarry should have celebrated his 18<sup>th</sup> birthday this year. I never got to see him grow up. I don?t know what he would look like now or sound like with a manly voice. Would he have gone to university? These questions I can?t answer. But what I do know is that he achieved great things and would want me to continue the hard work and live out my own dreams. So instead of cake and parties, I honour him with charity events and fulfilling his legacy. It?s all I can do for him now but I know it would make him happy. But simultaneously, it makes me happy.\n\nThis is the point to my writing. It?s great to have a vision and path that you want to follow. Keep that vision and do everything you can to make it happen. But if you don?t, that?s okay, too.

(We?ve already seen some Advent Calendars on sale?)\n\nOn top of that, it?ll soon be autumn a.k.a. the time when we all get the chance to bring out the knitted jumpers and woolly hats, and sit cosily on the sofa.\n\nAlso, is it just us who are looking forward to being a bit more recluse and enjoying quiet nights in watching Strictly and X Factor??\n\nThe summer days are over and it?s time to knuckle down and refocus your mind.\n\nJanuary is typically known as the time for a fresh start, but there is less to look forward to in January. Most people are financially struggling due to the overspend at Christmas, it?s cold and snowing in the UK (although we are partial to a bit of snow every now and again), and summer seems so far away.\n\nBut in September the weather is at a nice state before cooling down, Christmas is just around the corner and the kids are back at school so there is a bit more peace and quiet.\n<h2><strong>New Year, New You</strong></h2>\nA ?new year, new you? isn\'t exclusive to January as dictated by the calendar year; to us, it?s the academic year, which traditionally occurs in September. One of the benefits of distance learning is that you can start education at any point in the year, not just September or January. But there is an organic feeling about the month of September that seems to bring about a sense of productivity.\n\nWithin the academic year, examinations often occur in January, meaning that the joyous holiday period is overridden with revision and stress. But with distance learning, you can work at your own pace and choose to sit your exams when you are ready.\n\nSo while it is sad to say goodbye to the summer, the start of a new season should be more than welcomed. Time to welcome a new education, a new career and, ultimately, a new you.\n\n<a class=\"blog-cta\" href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/pages/how-it-works.html\">Start your new year today</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2018-09-19 08:58:39','2018-09-19 08:58:39',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/8789-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

	(1973,'A Day in the Life of a Teaching Assistant - Marie\'s Story','day-life-teaching-assistant',NULL,NULL,'A teaching assistant is a vital role within the school community. They assist the teacher with daily classroom and teaching responsibilities, and also act as a role model to children and help to educate the future generations.\n\nMarie Copeland has been a teaching assistant for almost 20 years. She loves the job and wants to tell her story to inspire more people to do the same.\n<h3><strong>Tell us a bit about yourself and your home life. </strong></h3>\nI am a married mum of 3 adult children ? and a teaching assistant as you know. There?s not much to say to be completely honest. I am quite ?normal? in most respects. I?m part of a women?s running group and spend most of my free time with my family and friends. I?d say I?m quite active. I\'m a member of the National Trust so enjoy visiting historical sites and exploring the English countryside.\n<h3><strong>What made you want to become a teaching assistant? </strong></h3>\nI didn?t know straight away that I wanted to be a teaching assistant, but I always knew that I wanted to work with children. When my youngest child started nursery, I used to occupy my time by going along to help out a few afternoons during the week. It worked out well for me. It meant that I could do something I enjoy while spending time with my own children. After a period doing this, I knew it was something I wanted to do full time because I really enjoyed it.\n\nIt was an ideal solution for both my career and personal life. It meant I didn?t need to arrange childcare, and could spend more time with my own children as well as others.\n<h3><strong>How did you study/train?</strong></h3>\nI started a bit later than most at the age of 31. My youngest child was in nursery so it made sense. My child\'s school gave me the opportunity to complete a placement with them. This meant I could gain experience whilst studying at home and attending college once a week.\n\nIt honestly was the perfect set up. My entire family would sit around the dinner table ? me doing my coursework and my children doing their homework. It really gave me a sense of purpose and helped me to feel more like a role model to my children. I think seeing their mother doing ?homework? too encouraged my children to do their own. Plus, it showed them that learning isn?t something that is just for children; you?re never too old to learn.\n\nWith that in mind, I?m currently studying a new specialist course that looks at working with children to support them with matters concerning issues at home, such as bereavement.\n<h3><strong>What?s the average day like for a teaching assistant?</strong></h3>\nTo be honest, there is not really an ?average day?, which is one of the aspects that I love about my job. Typically, my day starts welcoming the children and ensuring they have everything they need for the day. This could be anything from their work, to breakfast or ? on the rare occasion ? clothes!\n\nDuring the morning, I spend my time working with groups of SEND (Special Education Needs and Disabilities) children to provide them with extra support in maths and English, helping them to develop in these areas. I do a lot of one-on-one work with individual children, too. This could be listening to reading, or providing support in other subject areas. Or I may be working with groups of children on projects or offering additional support.\n<h3><strong>What?s your favourite things about the role? </strong></h3>\nThe short (and perhaps obvious) answer is the children! I am fortunate to be able to spend a lot of time with a variety of different children, meaning I get to know them really well. I am the children?s first point of call and role model within my position, which allows me to build really positive and trusting relationships.\n\nPlus I get to go on a lot of fun activity days out!\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/storage/images/media_items/old_images/2018/10/marie-copeland2-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-8843\" src=\"/storage/images/media_items/old_images/2018/10/marie-copeland2-1.png\" height=\"244\" width=\"300\" alt=\"A Day in the Life of a Teaching Assistant\" /></a></h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>What?s the worst thing about the role? </strong></h3>\nDealing with sick! I don?t think anything can prepare you or make you immune to having to clean up sick. Not even having your own children. But I?ve become really good at spotting when a child is about to be sick and grabbing the closest waste paper basket for them.\n<h3><strong>Do you think you would ever want to train to become a teacher? </strong></h3>\nPersonally no, although I know many teaching assistants who have gone on to become teachers when the time was right for them. For me, I have a really great work life balance and I enjoy the unique bonds that I get to build with the students. You don?t have as many of these opportunities as a teacher.\n<h3><strong>If you could give any advice for aspiring teachers/teaching assistants, what would it be? </strong></h3>\nDon?t take criticism to heart! If someone is giving you feedback it\'s really important that you listen and take it on board, regardless of how long you?ve been doing your job for.

There?s not much to say to be completely honest, I am quite ?normal? in most respects. I?m a part of a women?s running group and spend most of my free time with my family and friends. I?d say I?m quite active; I am a member of the National Trust so enjoy visiting historical sites and exploring the English countryside.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li><strong>What made you want to become a teaching assistant? </strong></li>\n</ol>\nI didn?t know straight away that I wanted to be a teaching assistant, but I knew that I always wanted to work with children. When my youngest started nursery, I used to occupy my time by going along to help out a few afternoons during the week. It worked out for me as it meant that I could do something that I enjoy while spending time with my own children. After a period of time doing this, I knew it was something I would want to do full time because I really enjoyed it.\n\nIt worked out all round for my career and personal life as it meant that I didn?t need to arrange childcare and could spend more time with my own children as well as others.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li><strong>How did you study/train?</strong></li>\n</ol>\nI started a bit later than most at the age of 31. My youngest was in nursery so it made sense; the opportunity was given to me by my children?s school whereby I could complete a placement with them whilst funding my <strong><u>CACHE course</u></strong>. This allowed me to work while attending college once a week.\n\nIt honestly was the perfect set up. My entire family would sit around the dinner table ? me doing my coursework and my children doing their homework. It really gave me a sense of purpose and helped me to feel more like a role model to my children. I think seeing their mother doing ?homework?, too, made my children more encouraged to do their own. Plus, it showed them that learning isn?t something that is just for children; you?re never too old to learn.\n\nWith that said, I?m also currently studying a new specialist course that looks at working with children to support them with matters concerning issues at home such as bereavement\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li><strong>What?s the average day like for a teaching assistant?</strong></li>\n</ol>\nTo be honest, there is not really an ?average day?, which is one of the aspects that I love about my job. But typically, my day starts welcoming the children and ensuring they have everything they need for the day. This could be anything from their work, to breakfast or ? on the rare occasion ? clothes!\n\nDuring the morning, I spend my time working with groups of SEND (Special Education Needs and Disabilities) children to provide them with extra support in maths and English, helping them to develop in these areas. I do a lot of one-on-one work with individual children, too. This could be listening to reading or providing support in other subject areas. Or I may be working with groups of children on projects or offering additional support.\n<ol start=\"5\">\n 	<li><strong>What?s your favourite things about the role? </strong></li>\n</ol>\nThe short (and perhaps obvious) answer is the children! I am fortunate to be able to spend a lot of time with a variety of different children, meaning I get to know them really well. I am the children?s point of call and role model within my position, which allows me to build really positive and trusting relationships.\n\nPlus I get to go on a lot of fun activity days out!\n\n<a href=\"/storage/images/media_items/old_images/2018/10/marie-copeland2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-8840\" src=\"/storage/images/media_items/old_images/2018/10/marie-copeland2.png\" alt=\"A Day in the Life of a Teaching Assistant\" height=\"169\" width=\"300\"/></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"6\">\n 	<li><strong>What?s the worst thing about the role? </strong></li>\n</ol>\nDealing with sick! I don?t think anything can prepare you or make you immune to having to clean up sick. Not even having your own children. But I?ve become really good at spotting when a child is about to be sick and grabbing the closest waste paper basket for them.\n<ol start=\"7\">\n 	<li><strong>Do you think you would ever want to train to become a teacher? </strong></li>\n</ol>\nPersonally no, although I know many teaching assistants who have gone on to become teachers when the time was right for them. For me, I have a really great work life balance and I enjoy the unique bonds that I get to build with the students. You don?t have as many of these opportunities as a teacher.\n<ol start=\"8\">\n 	<li><strong>If you could give any advice for aspiring teachers/teaching assistants, what would it be? </strong></li>\n</ol>\nDon?t take criticism to heart! When someone is giving you feedback, its really important that you listen and take it on board regardless of how long you?ve been doing your job for. Keep in mind that they are only trying to help you get better at your job.\n\nIf Marie has inspired you, browse our Childcare courses to see how you can become a Teaching Assistant, too.\n\n<a class=\"blog-cta\" href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/childcare_courses.html\">Take a look at our courses</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2018-10-04 15:18:19','2018-10-04 15:18:19',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/8839-revision-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

	(1978,'The truth about common nutrition myths','5494-autosave-v1',NULL,NULL,'In a world full of vegans, flexitarians and fitness fanatics having a healthy diet and good nutrition is a key component to our lives.\n\nThere are so many theories and myths about what is good for us, what isn\'t, what we should be eating, and how we should live our lives. People seem to think they know what?s good for us, which is all well and good, but are there any facts to prove it? In addition, each person is different so what may be good for the few might not be for the many.\n\nTo help put you at ease, here are the top 5 most common nutrition approaches and the truth behind the myth...\n<h2>Drinking fruit juice</h2>\nFruit juices contain more sugar than people may like to admit. Yes, it may be natural sugars if you buy natural and not from concentrate, but the majority are made from water and sugar with added chemicals for preservation and taste. Some can even contain the same amount of sugar that is included in Coca Cola and Pepsi!\n\nSwap your fruit juice for water and eat real fruit instead. This will do much more for your body and health than fruit juices.\n<h2>Eating \'Superfoods\'</h2>\nWhen looking for food products you should always check the label. Although foods may be branded as a superfood, it doesn\'t mean that they don\'t contain any calories or that they are the best choice. For  example, did you know that 50g of dried goji berries (a supposed superfood) contain 155 calories? But did you also know that 100g of strawberries contain 30 calories? Double the portion and less than half of the calories. Always read the label and don\'t just trust what you are told.\n<h2>Whole Wheat</h2>\nWhole wheat has a lot of nutritional benefits. It contains more fiber than white carbohydrates which regulates your digestive system and helps to keep you fuller for longer. BUT, it still contains a lot of calories and carbohydrates; eating too much of this will still result in weight gain and can increase cholesterol.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Just counting your calories</h2>\nAlthough our calorie intake is important to us, you shouldn\'t focus on this solely. You should also pay attention to choosing the right food to eat and making your body want to lose weight. By eating less sugar and carbohydrates with more protein and fat can help you to lose weight without even counting a single calorie.\n\nPortion Size\n\nSmaller portions does not always equal less calories. You could have a single McDonald\'s Big Mac Burger but this wouldn\'t be healthier than a large plate of chicken salad. Nor would it have as few calories. Think about what food you eat more than how much you eat\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you would like to know more about our diet and nutrition why not enrol on our <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/ncfe-nutrition-consultant.html?dc=4\">Level 3 Nutrition Consultant</a> course today!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/ncfe-nutrition-consultant.html?dc=4\">Take a look at our Nutrition Consultant Level 3 course &gt;&gt;</a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2018-10-10 12:47:14','2018-10-10 12:47:14',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/5494-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

I was working at HMRC at the time and they were very supportive. I also had a new man in my life who could have easily walked away, but instead he stayed and cared for me.\n\nDuring that time, I had to have a full hysterectomy and then chemotherapy. This meant I had a lot of time on my hands, so I had the opportunity to do a lot of thinking.\n\nI began to think hard about what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.

After some thought, I decided that wanted to learn more about payroll, but at the time my situation wouldn?t allow me to do anything about it.\n<h5><strong>Getting back on my feet</strong></h5>\nA year or so later I was cancer and treatment free. Once I was back on my feet, I decided to go for it and explore payroll further, thankfully with the full support of my partner. He?s the kind of guy who struggles to decide what he wants for dinner, but if I tell him I want to do or learn something new, then he will always tell me to go for it.\n\nWhen I started looking into payroll courses, I came across Open Study College and they seemed ideal. They even offered a payment plan, so I didn?t have to worry about paying for the course all at once.\n\nMy partner was very supportive, so I applied for the course. During my course I realised I enjoyed payroll and wanted to make a career out of it. The HMRC office I was working at was also due to close in a few years? time. My partner lived a few miles away and wanted to be nearer, so my new career seemed to make perfect sense for us.\n<h5><strong>Changing my career</strong></h5>\nI successfully passed my course and managed to find a temporary job to help me get some experience.

Of course, I jumped at the chance! The temporary position soon turned permanent, and I have been a manager at Enham Trust for 3 years. I even enrolled two of my staff onto the payroll course with Open Study College. I am very pleased to say they both passed! One of them was even promoted to Senior Payroll Officer shortly after completing her studies.\n\nPart of my duties as Payroll Manager is doing my monthly accounts.

I discovered that I had developed a love of numbers, so I had the idea of studying a bookkeeping course to improve my understanding.\n\nAs I had studied payroll with Open Study College previously, they were my first port of call.

I?m now halfway through my level 2 and once I have finished that, I will begin the level 3 course.\n<h5><strong>Future plans</strong></h5>\nMy end goal is to have my own business offering payroll and bookkeeping services.

	(2002,'Sultana Ahmed: combining education and exercise','sultana-ahmed-combining-education-exercise',NULL,NULL,'Open Study College Student Sultana shares her education and exercise journey with us:\n\n\"Motherhood had me enrolled rather early on in my life. While most 18-year olds were choosing their university course, I was choosing my wedding dress. Not long after that, I found myself cradling my new-born son. Any intention I had of further study was extinguished like a flickering candle flame against a powerful storm. Over the next decade, I became committed to raising my children and pleasing others. I lost my own identity. Eventually, I found myself at a crossroads, deciding what I really wanted the rest of my life to look like. That was when my desire to study rekindled.\n<h3>I realised that I couldn?t pour from an empty cup</h3>\nIf I developed myself academically as an individual, I would be more capable of creating a better future for my children. My own happiness and success are my children?s happiness and successes. I wanted to be a role model for my them but first I had to let go of my fear. I had previously refrained from taking on such an intensive task of studying due to fear of incompetence and failure, but I then found distance learning and realised I could make this work for me. There was no hesitation; I decided to dive in first with two A Level courses. The feeling I had when I enrolled onto the courses is really memorable - I had overcome that mound of fear that had held me back for so long.\n<h3>I was really impressed with distance learning</h3>\nI was able to study in my own time, fitting my studies around my children, and at a speed that I was comfortable with. Excited with my new venture, I also began to feel a little overwhelmed with my new busy schedule, until one day, something extraordinary happened: I discovered running.  It was a cool April afternoon at my son?s primary school Fun Run that inadvertently brought about a way of easing the stress and impacting my life in a positive way.\n<h3>A sense of achievement</h3>\nAfter running alongside my son, I remember feeling a sense of triumphant achievement and empowerment. Not only was I able to enjoy some quality time with my son, but I was able to experience something new that I may not have done in any other situation. My son and I both high-fived one another and I came home feeling unusually joyful.\n\nSince that experience, I have become a regular runner and completed two 10K runs and begun training for a half marathon. I ? as others may also be ? was amazed at my own determination to complete these as well as my studies between school runs, packed lunch preparations and all other responsibilities; I was convinced that there was more to it.\n\nAs weeks turned into months, I began to worry that I had bitten off more than I could chew. Although taking care of my children and studying were at the top of my priority list, I felt that running shouldn?t be pushed to the bottom. I was convinced that there was a link between my running and the way my brain was responding to it. I felt a compulsion to keep running in order to manage my stresses; it had intensely changed my mindset. Besides, even when I was not running, I was still running; running after the children!\n\n<a href=\"/storage/images/media_items/old_images/2018/12/sultana1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8911 aligncenter\" src=\"/storage/images/media_items/old_images/2018/12/sultana1.jpg\" height=\"225\" width=\"300\" alt=\"Sultana Ahmed: Exercise and Education\" /></a>\n<h3>I was happier</h3>\nI was more determined, and I found I was able to concentrate on tasks more efficiently. Consequently, I began to develop a deeper interest in exercise and fitness. One that moved past extra-curricular. I thought that if the benefits of running could have such an impact on me, imagine the effect that in-depth study could bring. Because of this newfound determination, I began to research the links that existed between exercise and the brain. In doing so, I stumbled across some very interesting facts and studies.\n<h3>The benefits of exercise</h3>\nModerate runs can result in very real benefits. I recently listened to an interesting podcast by Dr Rangan Chatterjee where he speaks to William Pullen, author of ?Run for your life?. They discussed how depression and anxiety can be treated by a concept he refers to as ?dynamic running therapy?. Pullen, who is a psychotherapist by profession, mentions that running helps to bring up feelings of clarity. Dr Chatterjee agreed, explaining that running had helped one of his friends to destress and bring creative ideas to the core. They then went on to discuss what happens to the brain chemistry after running: as the runner is not consciously thinking, the brain is working more efficiently in a subconscious way.\n<blockquote>?That?s the process of education and empowerment, you learn to make good choices that make you feel great? said Dr Chatterjee, and I wholly agree.</blockquote>\nWe often focus on external needs and demands yet deny the demands of our own mind and body. As a mother, it is important to take care of myself to ensure that I am in the best possible state to take care of my children. Exercise was my release. It was somewhere I could completely be myself. I need to focus on my own development to aid that of my children; and this is something that we all neglect.\n<h3>It is perfectly acceptable to put yourself first</h3>\nIn my case, distance learning and running became a great way to do this without feeling guilty. Both our mental and physical health are of equal importance. I would say that exercise and studying go hand in hand. So, to all students who may feel like they are at a standstill with their studies:\n<blockquote>?However stuck you feel, if you just put one foot in front of the other, and keep moving, things will change. Things will get better.?</blockquote>\nMr Pullen, Movement is Medicine (August 2018)\"\n\nThanks to Sultana for sharing her experiences with us.\n\nDid you know you can combine a love of exercise with distance learning? <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/qualifications/active-iq\">Our ActiveIQ courses</a> cover topics including fitness instruction, personal training and nutrition.\n\nPrefer to study a different subject?

But studying as a hobby can be equally, if not more, rewarding.\n\nAccording to the Oxford dictionary, a hobby is \"an activity done regularly in one\'s leisure time for pleasure\". Humans have engaged in hobbies since time began; doing things to keep busy during long days. As times have changed and people\'s lives have become busier with work, family and looking after a home, the need for hobbies has perhaps become even more important. Dedicating time to personal enjoyment can reduce stress and provide a much needed escape from everyday life.\n\nWhen studying is done for pleasure, rather than as a necessity, it becomes a hobby. That\'s not to say that educational or work based study isn\'t enjoyable - indeed it should be in order to achieve success. But studying as a hobby involves choosing a subject matter purely for enjoyment. There may be no need or desire for achievement, like a final exam, qualification or credential. Just learning more about the subject is enough.\n\nLet\'s look at 5 great reasons for considering studying as a hobby.\n<h3>Expanding your horizons</h3>\nThe world is so full of things that we, as individuals, may not know anything about.

Carrie Weston recently studied a level 3 Fiction Writing course with Open Study College and was able to achieve that dream. She recently released her debut novel, Xander Chase and the Unicorn Code. We caught up with Carrie to let her share her story...</h4>\n<h2>Choosing a career path</h2>\nI have always wanted to pursue a writing career since leaving school. Unfortunately I was told my English grades weren?t high enough to attain a place on a writing course. So instead I went to Herefordshire College of Technology where I studied catering and became the head chef of a local pub restaurant by the age of 19.\n\nThe recession led me to pursue confectionery training which I passed with a masters. But due to unforeseen circumstances and ongoing health issues, my life took a different road.\n<h2>Following my dreams</h2>\nI decided to follow my dreams and began researching writing colleges that didn?t require A levels. Ones that had friendly helpful tutors. I researched a lot of online colleges, but Open Study Collage appealed most with it\'s content, offering learning from basic English language to long term goals and getting published.\n\nIn September 2015, my mother purchased the course ? Fiction Writing Level 3 ? for me as a birthday gift and I began studying straight away. What I liked most was the fact that upon telling you I was dyslexic you said ?no problem?. I also had a wonderful tutor, Angela. She never found any question too inconsequential and I received detailed notes on all of my projects.\n\nIt has always been a dream of mine to become an authoress, so when I had the opportunity to send work off, I did. Now I am the proud authoress of the crime fiction novel; Xander Chase and the Unicorn Code.\n<h2>Thanks Carrie!</h2>\nXander Chase and the Unicorn Code is available to buy online now!\n\nIf you\'re interested in developing your writing skills, our <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/fiction-writing-course\">Fiction Writing Level 3 course </a>could be for you!

This is linked to the offering of cakes to the gods during February.\n\nWe much prefer the latter, as it sounds like something we can get on board with!

He studied medicine at Edinburgh University, later obtaining a degree in Theology.\n\nDarwin\'s most famous work \"Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection\" was published in 1859, and remains widely debated by scientists, sociologists, geologists and zoologists to this day.\n<h3>Birthplace of British Cinema</h3>\nRegent Street Cinema was the first to open its doors in the UK, premiering the first \"film\" in 1896. 54 people paid a shilling to watch several short daily life scenes, hand cranked by a projector. The \"films\" played ten times a day on the hour, to huge demand.\n<h3>Pounds, shilling and pence</h3>\nUp until January 1970, British people paid for goods and services in pennies and shillings - with 12 pennies to a shilling, and 20 shillings to the pound. On 15th February the country converted to decimal. Banks were closed for four days in advance to prepare for the change. The cost of converting telephone boxes across the country was £3m.

We recently caught up with Jade, 24, to find out more about her study journey and her big move to New York, here?s what she had to say...\n<h3><strong>What?s your background in terms of education and career?</strong></h3>\nIn terms of my education, I tried my hand at A-levels after secondary school however, I found after one year that I learned best by actual practice. With this in mind, I moved onto a BTEC in Print Based Media. I was studying multiple facets of media and marketing that would soon enable me to thrive in my current career.\n\nI started working at the age of 14 in a restaurant kitchen, progressing to the floor as a waitress. Eventually, I worked my way up to working for a restaurant and events venue. In this role, I waitressed and occasionally helped navigate the events in real time, leading the on-site floor team to ensure that the event experience was as expected, and more.\n\nAfter completing my BTEC course, I decided against university as I was keen to be in a working environment. Many unsuccessful interviews later, a restaurant customer kindly passed my CV onto an acquaintance who was running events in the corporate marketing space and was looking for an administrative and events assistant. The position offered a lot of prospects as it was a growing company in the tech sector. It seemed to be going in the right direction, and I bit as soon as they dangled their ?travel opportunities?.\n\nMy career started out with me learning the ropes of the business. I took the role of logistics manager; someone who gets people to the events and looks after the sponsors. This quickly developed and I got involved in multiple areas of the business including commercial sales, hosting, and leading marketing and logistics strategies. Going forward, I would have an integral voice within the business, be travelling the world to run events, and experiencing a number of challenges and successes.\n\nAfter 5 years in the business, I now help lead a team of seven people in the US, mentoring new event managers and travelling across North America and Canada organizing and hosting events. It is my intention to help the business grow and explore new avenues for the events that we run.\n<h3><strong>What made you want to study Event Management?</strong></h3>\nAs I was progressing in my job as an event manager, I was keen to learn more about events across various industries and see what I could apply to my current role.\n<h3><strong>What was your motivation for studying?</strong></h3>\nI believe that there is always more to learn, regardless of your success or stature. I also believe in trying to understand different perspectives and pain points. An event planner who is organising non-profit events may have challenges different from an event planner who is organising festivals, but they could learn a great deal from each other.\n<h3><strong>Why did you choose distance learning over traditional study methods?</strong></h3>\nAs I was in full time work, I didn\'t have the capacity to pursue traditional study methods. During my studies I had the opportunity to move to New York. Thankfully, I was lucky enough to be studying Open Study College, meaning I was able to continue with my course.\n<h3><strong>Why did you choose to study with Open Study College?</strong></h3>\nThe content of the course was exactly what I was looking for and it was affordable.\n<h3><strong>What have you enjoyed most about your studies?</strong></h3>\nI enjoyed working with my tutor, Sian, very much.

We recently caught up with Jade, 24, to find out more about her study journey and her big move to New York, here?s what she had to say.\n<h3><strong>What?s your background in terms of education and career?</strong></h3>\nIn terms of my education, I tried my hand at A-levels after secondary school however, I found after one year that I learned best by actual practice. With this in mind, I moved onto a BTEC in Print Based Media. I was studying multiple facets of media and marketing that would soon enable me to thrive in my current career.\n\nI started working at the age of 14 in a restaurant kitchen, progressing to the floor as a waitress. Eventually, I worked my way up to working for a restaurant and events venue. In this role, I waitressed and occasionally helped navigate the events in real time, leading the on-site floor team to ensure that the event experience was as expected, and more.\n\nAfter completing my BTEC course, I decided against university as I was keen to be in a working environment. Many unsuccessful interviews later, a restaurant customer kindly passed my CV onto an acquaintance who was running events in the corporate marketing space and was looking for an administrative and events assistant. The position offered a lot of prospects as it was a growing company in the tech sector. It seemed to be going in the right direction, and I bit as soon as they dangled their ?travel opportunities?.\n\nMy career started out with me learning the ropes of the business. I took the role of logistics manager; someone who gets people to the events and looks after the sponsors. This quickly developed and I got involved in multiple areas of the business including commercial sales, hosting, and leading marketing and logistics strategies. Going forward, I would have an integral voice within the business, be travelling the world to run events, and experiencing a number of challenges and successes.\n\nAfter 5 years in the business, I now help lead a team of seven people in the US, mentoring new event managers and travelling across North America and Canada organizing and hosting events. It is my intention to help the business grow and explore new avenues for the events that we run.\n<h3><strong>What made you want to study Event Management?</strong></h3>\nAs I was progressing in my job as an event manager, I was keen to learn more about events across various industries and see what I could apply to my current role.\n<h3><strong>What was your motivation for studying?</strong></h3>\nI believe that there is always more to learn, regardless of your success or stature. I also believe in trying to understand different perspectives and pain points. An event planner who is organising non-profit events may have challenges different from an event planner who is organising festivals, but they could learn a great deal from each other.\n<h3><strong>Why did you choose distance learning over traditional study methods?</strong></h3>\nAs I was in full time work, I didn\'t have the capacity to pursue traditional study methods. During my studies I had the opportunity to move to New York. Thankfully, I was lucky enough to be studying Open Study College, meaning I was able to continue with my course.\n<h3><strong>Why did you choose to study with Open Study College?</strong></h3>\nThe content of the course was exactly what I was looking for and it was affordable.\n<h3><strong>What have you enjoyed most about your studies?</strong></h3>\nI enjoyed working with my tutor, Sian, very much. Sian was extremely helpful and communicative. She really helped me to understand and manage the course, especially when I was moving countries.\n\nI enjoyed having the freedom to study in my own time and applying what I?ve learnt to my career.\n<h3><strong>What do you plan to do with your course after completing your studies? </strong></h3>\nI will continue to work as an event producer in my current role. I also have the prospect of running my own events business in the future, ideally in the eco-friendly climate sector.\n<h3><strong>Do you plan to study in the future? </strong></h3>\nI am always open to learning and studying, especially if I can transfer those learnings across multiple industries.\n<h3><strong>Is there anything else you?d like to add?</strong></h3>\nThank you to Open Study College for allowing me the chance to enrol and complete this course.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/event-management-courses\">Head over to our course page to find out more about our Event Management course. </a>',NULL,NULL,9,'2019-02-14 12:06:06','2019-02-14 12:06:06',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/9005-revision-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

When Robyn realised that the degree she had worked so hard for and the career path she was on, wasn?t the right route for her, she decided to explore alternative career paths. With a dream of working in the criminology industry, Robyn is keen to build up her knowledge in preparation for changing careers in the future. We caught up with Robyn to find out more about her reasons for choosing distance learning and her plans to change her career path?\n<h3><strong> </strong><strong>What?s your background in terms of education and career?</strong></h3>\nBefore starting my courses with Open Study College, I had already achieved a 2:1 Bachelor?s Degree from the University of Gloucestershire where I studied Multimedia Web Design and Development. Growing up I always had my heart set on working within the tech/design industry, so I took the most relevant courses to get me there as early as my GCSE\'s.\n\nDuring the time I was studying my qualifications I worked in various roles within the industry, I was even asked to go back to my old school and teach more modern techniques to students. Since graduating I\'ve gone through the typical post-grad nightmare of \'how the hell do I put this piece of paper that says I can do stuff to good use?!\'. Thankfully I eventually landed a job that, for the most part, used the skills I had acquired and for a little while I was pretty settled. The problem then was (and it\'s a problem that I am known for within my family) that I just got very bored of doing the same thing day in, day out.\n\nGoing through education, there are so many things changing and, as a young person, there are so many other things going on in your life. So much so that I didn\'t stop to think about if the career path I was taking would be one that would keep my keen and inquisitive mind satisfied. In some ways it does, I\'m able to go from project to project and small things are different each time, but ultimately it wasn\'t enough to keep me interested. I still work in the industry while I\'m studying with Open Study College, with the hope that I will be able to make a more drastic career change sooner rather than later.\n<h3><strong> </strong><strong>What made you want to study your chosen subject?</strong></h3>\nThe variety of topics I choose to study with Open Study College are all chosen to develop myself as a person, as well as the main goal of changing my career. When I look back and think about all the things I could have studied the first-time round, if I hadn\'t been so obsessed with technology, the obvious choice for me was always something based around forensics and criminology. There is no doubt that a career in that area would satisfy my problem with becoming bored easily, so when it came to trying things a second time round, Forensic Science, Crime Scene Investigation and similar courses were obvious starting points for me. If only I had taken these subjects first time round!\n<h3><strong> </strong><strong>What was your motivation for studying?</strong></h3>\nMy main motivation is the thought of someday being able to wake up in the morning and be truly excited to do my job. Even on days were I really don\'t want to get out of bed, or at times when it\'s really trying, I still want to be able to say there is nothing else I would rather be doing.\n<h3><strong> </strong><strong>Why did you choose distance learning over traditional study methods?</strong></h3>\nWell firstly, I?ve done the traditional methods and I don\'t think my body could handle another round of freshers! Most importantly though, I chose distance learning because I have to fit my education around a job and various other things; adult things that really none of us want, but we have them anyway. This way I\'m able to take my time with the course and work on it at times that suit me, all while maintaining my other responsibilities.\n<h3><strong> </strong><strong>Why did you choose to study with Open Study College?</strong></h3>\nI chose to study with Open Study College because at first glance I could see they had a massive range of courses. I saw the opportunity to use their course range to my advantage and they were all at a price I could afford, even offering an instalment scheme. Looking further into it, I saw the reviews from previous students were glowing and overall it looked like a great tool to base my future learning around. So far, they have truly surpassed my expectations; the tutor support is fantastic, and the team are very active when it comes to offering praise for your achievements, which is a huge thing when you\'re taking your first steps into ultimately the unknown. The constant support they provide goes a long way.\n<h3><strong>What have you enjoyed most about your studies?</strong></h3>\nI\'ve always enjoyed learning new things; I have this rule where I make sure I only learn about things that interest me, so I can have a greater understanding about why it interests me. One of the things that stands out to me though is how much I enjoy working through the course material and actually writing the assignments? even more so is the feeling I get when I get my results back and they\'re as good as they are! #humblebrag\n<h3><strong> </strong><strong>What do you plan to do with your course after completing your studies?</strong></h3>\nThe ultimate goal is to have some kind of career within the police force, it\'ll take some time, but I\'ll get there one day!\n<h3><strong> </strong><strong>Do you plan to study any further in the future?</strong></h3>\nHaving already completed the Forensic Science Level 3 course and being half way through my Crime Scene Investigations Level 3 course, it\'s fair to say that I will be coming back to study more without a doubt! There are a number of other courses I am planning to take in future including: Criminology, Forensic Ballistics, Psychological Profiling and many more.\n<h3><strong> </strong><strong>Is there anything else you?d like to add?</strong></h3>\nMostly I would like to thank the team at Open Study College for helping me get back into education, which has allowed me to take the first steps towards my dream job. I\'m sure I\'m not the first person that wishes they had done things differently the first time around with college and university, and I\'m even more sure that I won\'t be the last! It\'s reassuring to know that Open Study College is there for people when they are ready to get back into learning and make the changes they want to make.\n\nIf you would like to find out more about the courses Robyn has studied with us, take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/forensic-science-level-3\">Forensic Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/crime-scene-investigation-3\">Crime Scene Investigation</a> course pages.',NULL,NULL,9,'2019-02-25 16:55:12','2019-02-28 15:00:56',2,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/?p=9025',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL);

I saw the opportunity to use their course range to my advantage and they were all at a price I could afford, even offering an instalment scheme. Looking further into it, I saw the reviews from previous students were glowing and overall it looked like a great tool to base my future learning around. So far, they have truly surpassed my expectations; the tutor support is fantastic, and the team are very active when it comes to offering praise for your achievements, which is a huge thing when you\'re taking your first steps into ultimately the unknown. The constant support they provide goes a long way.\n<h3><strong>What have you enjoyed most about your studies?</strong></h3>\nI\'ve always enjoyed learning new things; I have this rule where I make sure I only learn about things that interest me, so I can have a greater understanding about why it interests me. One of the things that stands out to me though is how much I enjoy working through the course material and actually writing the assignments? even more so is the feeling I get when I get my results back and they\'re as good as they are! #humblebrag\n<h3><strong> </strong><strong>What do you plan to do with your course after completing your studies?</strong></h3>\nThe ultimate goal is to have some kind of career within the police force, it\'ll take some time, but I\'ll get there one day!\n<h3><strong> </strong><strong>Do you plan to study any further in the future?</strong></h3>\nHaving already completed the Forensic Science Level 3 course and being half way through my Crime Scene Investigations Level 3 course, it\'s fair to say that I will be coming back to study more without a doubt! There are a number of other courses I am planning to take in future including: Criminology, Forensic Ballistics, Psychological Profiling and many more.\n<h3><strong> </strong><strong>Is there anything else you?d like to add?</strong></h3>\nMostly I would like to thank the team at Open Study College for helping me get back into education, which has allowed me to take the first steps towards my dream job. I\'m sure I\'m not the first person that wishes they had done things differently the first time around with college and university, and I\'m even more sure that I won\'t be the last! It\'s reassuring to know that Open Study College is there for people when they are ready to get back into learning and make the changes they want to make.\n\nIf you would like to find out more about the courses Robyn has studied with us, take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/forensic-science-level-3\">Forensic Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/crime-scene-investigation-3\">Crime Scene Investigation</a> course pages.',NULL,NULL,9,'2019-02-20 11:25:00','2019-02-20 11:25:00',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/9025-revision-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

As someone who found school challenging, I definitely recommend distance learning to anyone who is also struggling/has struggled.\n<h3><strong>Why did you choose to study with Open Study College?</strong></h3>\nI chose Open Study College as I know that when you sign up to your course, you are assigned a tutor that it available to help you every step of the way.

Recent years have seen many leaps and bounds in the progress of women in the workplace, but this day also serves as a reminder of continuing issues that we are tackling even today.\n\nReflecting on my own experiences as a woman in business and CEO of Open Study College, I can vouch for the fact that women still face significant challenges in the workplace.\n\nOne of the most salient issues, I believe, is the role flexible working and home learning have to play, if we are to move towards a truly inclusive employment culture in which women can excel.\n<h3>My journey to the CEO seat</h3>\nBack in 2007, while working in retail and studying law, I found myself craving greater professional autonomy and a more stimulating work environment. Meanwhile, my father was working in a distance learning company, and felt there was scope to set up a new business, He suggested that we join forces to launch the new venture, and I seized the opportunity.\n\nOur beginnings were small ? in common with most new businesses. We started working from an office in our garage, reselling educational content before going on to develop our own from 2011. In 2018, I was appointed CEO, a promotion from my previous role of Chief Operations Officer.\n\nOpen Study Group has now grown to over £7m annual turnover. We employ a team of 42 staff, with women making up 65% of the workforce and 50% of the senior management positions.\n<h3>Experiences of being a woman in the boardroom</h3>\nAs the business grew and developed, my role began to encompass more external events and activities. It became increasingly clear at the time that, in many professional situations, it felt like a man?s world. Whether sitting on judging panels for industry awards, or attending important meetings, I often found myself the only woman in the room feeling ?like I had something to prove? .\n\nI believe age also plays a role - especially when confronted by a group of older male professionals. The truth, is as a young woman, you can often feel you have to work extra hard to be taken seriously, listened to and respected in the workplace.\n\nIn situations like these, my approach is always to show strong self-confidence, make an impact and force people to take you seriously. There are plenty of occasions when I have been able to change the dynamic and leave with a win.\n<h3>The challenges still faced by women in the workplace</h3>\nA lot has changed since 2007 when Open Study College was born. Campaigns like #MeToo and #TimesUp have propelled inappropriate and abusive behaviour towards women in the workplace into public consciousness, making people and companies take a long hard look at themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a rise in women CEOs, leaders and pioneering female role models in the public eye. Even considering the last five years alone, it truly feels there has been a significant shift in the landscape and the public consciousness.\n\nHowever, the age-old concern of ?Can I have it all?? continues to cast a shadow. The question of whether, and how, a woman can have both a successful career and raise a family goes to the root of traditional attitudes and gender roles.\n\nMen were always expected to be the breadwinners, and women were cast as the carers. While our society has thankfully evolved, business and working culture still lag behind in many respects.\n\nI hear that employers can often still get ?nervous? about hiring a young woman, concerned about breaks in service for maternity leave and the impact that will have on the business.\n\nBut the truth is we absolutely can have successful careers and families, as long as the labour market embraces flexibility.\n<h3>Home learning and flexible working unlock more possibilities for women</h3>\nAt Open Study College we don?t believe flexibility in the workplace should be limited to larger companies and corporations ? it needs to be available at every level of the job market.\n\nAs a business our size, we know our staff have many out-of-work commitments including adult- and childcare responsibilities, which still fall disproportionately onto women. Finding ways for them to perform their roles while fulfilling these duties means we can get the best out of our staff and still offer them job satisfaction..\n\nOpen Study College courses have always seen greater take-up among women. This is partly due to some of the disciplines offered. However, it also reflects the fact that home learning is ideal for stay-at-home mothers, women on maternity leave or those looking to progress or change careers while juggling many different commitments.\n\nAs we begin to deliver higher level professional qualifications, we?re keen to encourage women to take up all the opportunities on offer to boost and build their careers, and see more women take on senior roles in business.\n\nWe also call on employers and businesses to recognise and harness the power of flexible working to unlock the potential of their female employees.\n\nAs a society, we?ve made significant progress in the arena of women in the workplace, from equal pay legislation to paid maternity leave to the growing crackdown on inappropriate behaviour and abuse.\n\nInternational Women?s Day is an opportunity to celebrate the achievements, but also to reinvigorate our efforts, so that women tomorrow have even greater choice and even more room to shine.\n\nTo find out more about distance learning and download a prospectus, <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/how-it-works\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">visit our website</a>.\n\n&nbsp;',NULL,NULL,9,'2019-03-08 09:42:04','2019-03-08 10:11:57',2,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/?p=9051',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

Recent years have seen many leaps and bounds in the progress of women in the workplace, but this day also serves as a reminder of continuing issues that we are tackling even today.\n\nReflecting on my own experiences as a woman in business and CEO of Open Study College, I can vouch for the fact that women still face significant challenges in the workplace.\n\nOne of the most salient issues, I believe, is the role flexible working and home learning have to play, if we are to move towards a truly inclusive employment culture in which women can excel.\n<h3>My journey to the CEO seat</h3>\nBack in 2007, while working in retail and studying law, I found myself craving greater professional autonomy and a more stimulating work environment. Meanwhile, my father was working in a distance learning company, and felt there was scope to set up a new business, He suggested that we join forces to launch the new venture, and I seized the opportunity.\n\nOur beginnings were small ? in common with most new businesses. We started working from an office in our garage, reselling educational content before going on to develop our own from 2011. In 2018, I was appointed CEO, a promotion from my previous role of Chief Operations Officer.\n\nOpen Study Group has now grown to over £7m annual turnover. We employ a team of 42 staff, with women making up 65% of the workforce and 50% of the senior management positions.\n<h3>Experiences of being a woman in the boardroom</h3>\nAs the business grew and developed, my role began to encompass more external events and activities. It became increasingly clear at the time that, in many professional situations, it felt like a man?s world. Whether sitting on judging panels for industry awards, or attending important meetings, I often found myself the only woman in the room feeling ?like I had something to prove? .\n\nI believe age also plays a role - especially when confronted by a group of older male professionals. The truth, is as a young woman, you can often feel you have to work extra hard to be taken seriously, listened to and respected in the workplace.\n\nIn situations like these, my approach is always to show strong self-confidence, make an impact and force people to take you seriously. There are plenty of occasions when I have been able to change the dynamic and leave with a win.\n<h3>The challenges still faced by women in the workplace</h3>\nA lot has changed since 2007 when Open Study College was born. Campaigns like #MeToo and #TimesUp have propelled inappropriate and abusive behaviour towards women in the workplace into public consciousness, making people and companies take a long hard look at themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a rise in women CEOs, leaders and pioneering female role models in the public eye. Even considering the last five years alone, it truly feels there has been a significant shift in the landscape and the public consciousness.\n\nHowever, the age-old concern of ?Can I have it all?? continues to cast a shadow. The question of whether, and how, a woman can have both a successful career and raise a family goes to the root of traditional attitudes and gender roles.\n\nMen were always expected to be the breadwinners, and women were cast as the carers. While our society has thankfully evolved, business and working culture still lag behind in many respects.\n\nI hear that employers can often still get ?nervous? about hiring a young woman, concerned about breaks in service for maternity leave and the impact that will have on the business.\n\nBut the truth is we absolutely can have successful careers and families, as long as the labour market embraces flexibility.\n<h3>Home learning and flexible working unlock more possibilities for women</h3>\nAt Open Study College we don?t believe flexibility in the workplace should be limited to larger companies and corporations ? it needs to be available at every level of the job market.\n\nAs a business our size, we know our staff have many out-of-work commitments including adult- and childcare responsibilities, which still fall disproportionately onto women.

	(2070,'Why Brexit is the ideal time to invest in your education','brexit-ideal-time-invest-education',NULL,NULL,'With ongoing uncertainty around Brexit, it can be tempting to just wait and see what happens before making any future career plans. But we think now is actually the ideal time to consider a distance learning course. Although the impact of Brexit isn\'t yet known, it\'s likely that there will be an effect on the job market in one way or another. With that in mind, being proactive in terms of the qualifications you would need to embark on a career change is likely to stand you in good stead.\n<h2>Which industries are likely to be affected by Brexit?</h2>\nBrexit will have the most impact on industries which rely heavily on trade with the EU. The automotive industry has already seen some changes which can be attributed to Brexit; including job losses at leading car manufacturers.\n\nManufacturing, tourism and financial services are also likely to be hit as a result. Some of the larger financial institutes have already mentioned contingency plans to relocate or open additional offices in Europe to negate the effects of having headquarters in the UK.\n\nThe NHS may also be affected. 1 in 20 NHS workers is currently from the EU. This figure is higher amongst doctors and dentists - 9% and 16% respectively (1). If these EU workers choose to return to their native country following Brexit, or future recruitment of NHS workers drops, the NHS will see a shortfall in staff which needs to be filled with UK workers.\n<h2>Look for employment opportunities</h2>\nUsing the NHS as an example, it\'s likely that demand for skilled healthcare staff could increase. Our <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/principles-of-nursing-practice-3?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Principles of Nursing Practice</a> could open up opportunities to work in public or private healthcare.\n\nSimilarly, if overseas travel is affected, the UK tourism industry could therefore reap the benefits. Capitalise on that with a <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/hotel-hospitality-diploma-5?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Level 5 Diploma in Hotel and Hospitality</a>!\n\nAccounting, bookkeeping and payroll services will always be in high demand by both small businesses and large organisations. Our accredited courses from <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/qualifications/aat?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AAT</a> (Association of Accounting Technicians), <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/qualifications/iab?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IAB </a>(International Association of Bookkeepers) and <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/qualifications/icb?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ICB </a>(Institute of Certified Bookkeepers) start at entry level for students who are completely new to the subject, through to more advanced for those wishing to further their existing career. Previous students have started their own business after studying with us, like <a href=\"https://blog.openstudycollege.com/icb-helping-mum-build-business/?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bookkeeper Julia</a>.\n\nChildcare, from home based child minding through to early years care and teaching assistants, will always be in demand. Accredited <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/qualifications/cache?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CACHE</a> qualifications (Council for Awards in Care, Health and Education) are recognised by employers. Similarly to our finance courses, they start at entry Level 1 through to more advanced levels.\n\nFinally, the personal care industry. Celebrity culture shows no signs of waning. Instagram has 1 billion monthly active users (2) - many of whom use the platform to share selfies. As a result, it seems we\'re continuing to be obsessed with appearance! Brits spent £7.6 billion on treatments in 2017 (3) with reasons ranging from looking one\'s best, to self care and better mental health. Why not capitalise on this by working in the industry? We offer a range of courses in <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/variant/beauty-therapy?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">beauty therapy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/fitness-courses?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">diet, fitness and nutrition</a>.

I have addressed several enquiries during my time as a student with your student support department and, I must say, that they have answered them in a timely, efficient manner.\n\nIf you\'re interested in finding out more about our range of <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/qualifications/aat\">AAT courses</a> or learning how we can help you achieve your career goals, take a look at <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/\">our website</a> or call our team on <strong>03300 563 100</strong>.',NULL,NULL,9,'2019-03-25 08:52:26','2019-03-25 08:52:26',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/9073-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

	(2079,'Why Brexit is the ideal time to invest in your education','9070-autosave-v1',NULL,NULL,'With ongoing uncertainty around Brexit, it can be tempting to just wait and see what happens before making any future career plans. But we think now is actually the ideal time to consider a distance learning course. Although the impact of Brexit isn\'t yet known, it\'s likely that there will be an effect on the job market in one way or another. With that in mind, being proactive in terms of the qualifications you would need to embark on a career change is likely to stand you in good stead.\n<h2>Which industries are likely to be affected by Brexit?</h2>\nBrexit will have the most impact on industries which rely heavily on trade with the EU. The automotive industry has already seen some changes which can be attributed to Brexit; including job losses at leading car manufacturers.\n\nManufacturing, tourism and financial services are also likely to be hit as a result. Some of the larger financial institutes have already mentioned contingency plans to relocate or open additional offices in Europe to negate the effects of having headquarters in the UK.\n\nThe NHS may also be affected. 1 in 20 NHS workers is currently from the EU. This figure is higher amongst doctors and dentists - 9% and 16% respectively (1). If these EU workers choose to return to their native country following Brexit, or future recruitment of NHS workers drops, the NHS will see a shortfall in staff which needs to be filled with UK workers.\n<h2>Look for employment opportunities</h2>\nUsing the NHS as an example, it\'s likely that demand for skilled healthcare staff could increase. Our <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/principles-of-nursing-practice-3?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Principles of Nursing Practice</a> could open up opportunities to work in public or private healthcare.\n\nSimilarly, if overseas travel is affected, the UK tourism industry could therefore reap the benefits. Capitalise on that with a <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/hotel-hospitality-diploma-5?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Level 5 Diploma in Hotel and Hospitality</a>!\n\nAccounting, bookkeeping and payroll services will always be in high demand by both small businesses and large organisations. Our accredited courses from <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/qualifications/aat?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AAT</a> (Association of Accounting Technicians), <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/qualifications/iab?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IAB </a>(International Association of Bookkeepers) and <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/qualifications/icb?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ICB </a>(Institute of Certified Bookkeepers) start at entry level for students who are completely new to the subject, through to more advanced for those wishing to further their existing career. Previous students have started their own business after studying with us, like <a href=\"https://blog.openstudycollege.com/icb-helping-mum-build-business/?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bookkeeper Julia</a>.\n\nChildcare, from home based child minding through to early years care and teaching assistants, will always be in demand. Accredited <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/qualifications/cache?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CACHE</a> qualifications (Council for Awards in Care, Health and Education) are recognised by employers. Similarly to our finance courses, they start at entry Level 1 through to more advanced levels.\n\nFinally, the personal care industry. Celebrity culture shows no signs of waning. Instagram has 1 billion monthly active users (2) - many of whom use the platform to share selfies. As a result, it seems we\'re continuing to be obsessed with appearance! Brits spent £7.6 billion on treatments in 2017 (3) with reasons ranging from looking one\'s best, to self care and better mental health. Why not capitalise on this by working in the industry? We offer a range of courses in <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/variant/beauty-therapy?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">beauty therapy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/fitness-courses?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">diet, fitness and nutrition</a>.

How about becoming a <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/nail-technician-artistry-courses?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nail technician</a> and starting your own business?\n<h3>\"The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take it away from you\" B.B.King</h3>\nWhether you choose to study specifically to benefit your career, or simply to improve your knowledge, you will almost certainly gain skills like time management and motivation. These can be applied to all aspects of your professional and personal life.\n\nWe offer various finance\n\nWhy not browse over 550 courses <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/?utm_source=Blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on our website</a>?

My mental health deteriorated in the following year, so I took some time away from studying in order to recover and think about what I wanted to do with my life.\n\nI came across distance learning in 2016 when searching for Criminal Psychology courses. I\'ve always been interested in criminology and when I saw the course with Open Study College I enrolled immediately. Distance learning really appealed to me as it meant I could do it in my own time without any commitments whilst coping with health issues.\n\nI achieved a distinction in my course, which gave me the motivation to look at boosting my qualifications further. I soon enrolled on iGCSE Sociology and achieved a grade C which I was really proud of.\n\nAfter completing my GCSE, it spurred on to do my A levels which is completely new to me. I am now studying A Levels in English Literature and Philosophy. My plan is to study then a HND in policing. Ultimately, my goal is to have a career with the police force.\n\nI chose to study with Open Study College in order to further my education for a number of reasons. Firstly, the tutor support I received during my first course was brilliant. Secondly, they offered a good range of courses that I was interested in and it is easy to enrol. And finally, studying with them is really straight forward; their course packs are very helpful and there are no time limits for assignments, so I don\'t have any pressure like I would attending a regular college.\n\nThe most enjoyable part of my studies is that I\'m studying because I want to, not because I have to. I get real enjoyment from my studies as I love what I am learning.\n\nI would like to say that I\'m sure there are many people in the same boat as me who have been through or are going through health difficulties. You would not regret distance learning. It really helped me get my life back on track and gave me a purpose, something that is very difficult when you are going through a tough time.\n\nFor me, I\'m 23 and unable to work, and whilst it might take me a bit longer to get there, it\'s better late than never. You can do it too! Even if it seems impossible.\n<h3>More information</h3>\nIf you would like to find out more about distance learning, get in touch with our team on 03300 563100.

I\'ve always been interested in criminology and when I saw the course with Open Study College I enrolled immediately. Distance learning really appealed to me as it meant I could do it in my own time without any commitments whilst coping with health issues.\n\nI achieved a distinction in my course, which gave me the motivation to look at boosting my qualifications further. I soon enrolled on iGCSE Sociology and achieved a grade C which I was really proud of.\n\nAfter completing my GCSE, it spurred on to do my A levels which is completely new to me. I am now studying A Levels in English Literature and Philosophy. My plan is to study then a HND in policing. Ultimately, my goal is to have a career with the police force.\n\nI chose to study with Open Study College in order to further my education for a number of reasons. Firstly, the tutor support is received during my first course was brilliant. Secondly, they offered a good range of courses that I was interested in and it is easy to enrol. And finally, studying with them is really straight forward; their course packs are very helpful and there are no time limits for assignments, so I don\'t have any pressure like I would attending a regular college.\n\nThe most enjoyable part of my studies is that I\'m studying because I want to, not because I have to. I get real enjoyment from my studies as I love what I am learning.\n\nI would like to say that I\'m sure there are many people in the same boat as me who have been through or are going through health difficulties. You would not regret distance learning. It really helped me get my life back on track and gave me a purpose, something that is very difficult when you are going through a tough time.\n\nFor me, I\'m 23 and unable to work, and whilst it might take me a bit longer to get there, it\'s better late than never.

Walter Diemar worked for the Fleer Chewing Gum Company in Philadelphia. For years the company had been searching for a less sticky formula which would enable bubbles to be blown. In 1928 Diemer was testing recipes and found a suitable one.  It was marketed as Dubble Bubble and sales surpassed $1.5m in the first year! It was bright pink in colour because that was the only dye he had to hand at the time.  In order to help sell the product, Diemer himself taught sales people how to blow bubbles, so they could pass the ?skill? on to potential customers.\n<h2>Scarface</h2>\nIt was accountants who brought down Chicago crime boss Al Capone. One of the most notorious American gangsters of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century and the inspiration behind scores of film and TV productions; Capone had a suspected crime sheet covering everything from bootlegging to murder. But it was a conviction for tax evasion that would ultimately put a stop to his criminal activity and land him in jail.\n<h2>Double O, double B, double K</h2>\nBookkeeper and the words derived from it (bookkeeping etc.) are the only words in the English language with 3 consecutive sets of double letters. You?re trying to think of others now, aren?t you? Think away, you won?t find any!\n<h2>And the winner is...</h2>\nEver wondered who counts up the votes to give us the Academy Award winners in the annual Oscars? It?s a team of accountants. Every year since the 1930s accountants have counted, recounted and counted again to ensure the accuracy of the votes placed. With over 6,000 Academy members eligible to vote, plus a published nomination list followed by announcing the final winners, that?s a lot of counting!

	(2101,'3 reasons why a company hires a finance professional','9162-revision-v1',NULL,NULL,'So you?re thinking of studying towards becoming a self-employed bookkeeper or accountant. First things first, is it worth it? Is there enough demand out there? What are the reasons why a company hires a finance professional, rather than looking after the numbers in house?\n\nThe good news is that even small companies hire finance professionals to look after their finances. This means there are plenty of potential clients out there, in all sorts of industries.\n\nHere are some of the reasons a company hires a finance professional\n<h1>To save money</h1>\nPaying to hire the services of a professional costs a business more money, surely? On the surface it would appear so. But a good accountant will be able to advise on where to cut costs or make changes to improve the figures. Anything spent on the expertise of a professional will be recouped in the positive savings they make for a business.\n<h1>To gain more time</h1>\nMost companies hire employees in a role in which they specialise ? be that sales, marketing, admin or something else. An employee who doesn?t specialise in bookkeeping but has been tasked with the job is therefore wasting time they could be spending on their actual role. A non-expert will invariably take much longer to complete a bookkeeping task than someone who is qualified and accredited. Most companies realise it?s best to trust the finances to the experts! This frees up their employees to do the jobs they?re employed for.\n<h1>To avoid breaking the law</h1>\nNo-one wants to get on the wrong side of the taxman. The consequences can be fatal for a small business and severely damaging for larger ones. Unpaid monies, fines and harm to reputation are all to be avoided; whatever the size of the organisation. When a company hires a finance professional they remove their fear of breaking the law, however unintentionally. This gives business owners peace of mind that their affairs are in good hands. Of course, as a highly qualified and accredited professional, you?ll have no such worries about getting things wrong, because you?ll have studied with Beancounters and received full tutor support for the duration of your course!\n\nReady to find out more about becoming a finance professional?\n\nBrowse our<a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/bookkeeping-courses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"color: #000032;\"> accounting, bookkeeping and payroll</span></a> courses, or <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">visit our website</a> for more information.\n\nPrefer to speak to someone?

Being a rockstar, for example, is great if you can make it. But it?s always good to have a back up career in mind just in case!\n\nHere are 5 celebrities who studied accounting. ? would you have guessed any of them?\n<h2>Mick Jagger</h2>\nBefore one of the most famous and enduring bands on the planet was born, Mick Jagger was a student at the London School of Economic, learning finance and accounting thanks to a scholarship place,\n\nThanks to his friendship with Keith Richards and Brian Jones, Jagger became more and more ensconced in the world of rock ?n? roll, and lasted less than a year at LSE before leaving to become a full time musician.\n<h2>Robert Plant</h2>\nAnother giant of the rock ?n? roll world was originally destined for a life of working with numbers. Plant?s Dad wanted him to become a chartered accountant, and enrolled him in lessons at the age of 16.\n\nUltimately his love of music won out, and he abandoned the lessons after just 2 weeks, in order to study music at college.\n<h2>John Grisham</h2>\nBefore famous legal thriller writer John Grisham became an author, he studied accounting at college; achieving his degree with the intention to progress onto study tax law. At law school he chose to study criminal law instead, which gave him lots of understanding and knowledge to apply to his books ? some of which would go on to be made into Hollywood movies.\n<h2>Eddie Izzard</h2>\nComedian Eddie Izzard comes from accounting stock ? his father was an accountant. Izzard went on to study the subject at the University of Sheffield, but failed all his exams and was unable to retake them.\n\nAccounting?s loss was comedy?s gain, as Izzard dedicated himself to performing.\n<h2>Kenny G</h2>\nJazz saxophonist Kenny G has sold more than 75 million records worldwide.  Prior to becoming successful on a global scale, he graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in accounting. He credits his background with helping him to manage his finances during his early career, and also used his knowledge and experience when it came to employing an accountant as his career progressed.\n<h3>Now, we\'re not saying that studying accounting can turn you into a celebrity!</h3>\nBut it will enable you to pursue a future-proof career which is in demand in every type of industry across the world.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/bookkeeping-courses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">View our full range of accounting courses</a>.\n\nPrefer to speak to someone about the courses we offer?

We recently caught up with Jade, 24, to find out more about her study journey and her big move to New York, here?s what she had to say...\n<h3><strong>What?s your background in terms of education and career?</strong></h3>\nIn terms of my education, I tried my hand at A-levels after secondary school however, I found after one year that I learned best by actual practice. With this in mind, I moved onto a BTEC in Print Based Media. I was studying multiple facets of media and marketing that would soon enable me to thrive in my current career.\n\nI started working at the age of 14 in a restaurant kitchen, progressing to the floor as a waitress. Eventually, I worked my way up to working for a restaurant and events venue. In this role, I waitressed and occasionally helped navigate the events in real time, leading the on-site floor team to ensure that the event experience was as expected, and more.\n\nAfter completing my BTEC course, I decided against university as I was keen to be in a working environment. Many unsuccessful interviews later, a restaurant customer kindly passed my CV onto an acquaintance who was running events in the corporate marketing space and was looking for an administrative and events assistant. The position offered a lot of prospects as it was a growing company in the tech sector. It seemed to be going in the right direction, and I bit as soon as they dangled their ?travel opportunities?.\n\nMy career started out with me learning the ropes of the business. I took the role of logistics manager; someone who gets people to the events and looks after the sponsors. This quickly developed and I got involved in multiple areas of the business including commercial sales, hosting, and leading marketing and logistics strategies. Going forward, I would have an integral voice within the business, be travelling the world to run events, and experiencing a number of challenges and successes.\n\nAfter 5 years in the business, I now help lead a team of seven people in the US, mentoring new event managers and travelling across North America and Canada organizing and hosting events. It is my intention to help the business grow and explore new avenues for the events that we run.\n<h3><strong>What made you want to study Event Management?</strong></h3>\nAs I was progressing in my job as an event manager, I was keen to learn more about events across various industries and see what I could apply to my current role.\n<h3><strong>What was your motivation for studying?</strong></h3>\nI believe that there is always more to learn, regardless of your success or stature. I also believe in trying to understand different perspectives and pain points. An event planner who is organising non-profit events may have challenges different from an event planner who is organising festivals, but they could learn a great deal from each other.\n<h3><strong>Why did you choose distance learning over traditional study methods?</strong></h3>\nAs I was in full time work, I didn\'t have the capacity to pursue traditional study methods. During my studies I had the opportunity to move to New York. Thankfully, I was lucky enough to be studying Open Study College, meaning I was able to continue with my course.\n<h3><strong>Why did you choose to study with Open Study College?</strong></h3>\nThe content of the course was exactly what I was looking for and it was affordable.\n<h3><strong>What have you enjoyed most about your studies?</strong></h3>\nI enjoyed working with my tutor, Sian, very much. Sian was extremely helpful and communicative. She really helped me to understand and manage the course, especially when I was moving countries.\n\nI enjoyed having the freedom to study in my own time and applying what I?ve learnt to my career.\n<h3><strong>What do you plan to do with your course after completing your studies? </strong></h3>\nI will continue to work as an event producer in my current role. I also have the prospect of running my own events business in the future, ideally in the eco-friendly climate sector.\n<h3><strong>Do you plan to study in the future? </strong></h3>\nI am always open to learning and studying, especially if I can transfer those learnings across multiple industries.\n<h3><strong>Is there anything else you?d like to add?</strong></h3>\nThank you to Open Study College for allowing me the chance to enrol and complete this course.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">----------</p>\nHead over to our website to find out more about our <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/event-management-courses?utm_source=blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Event Management course</a>.\n\nEvent management not for you? <u><span style=\"color: #000120;\"><a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/?utm_source=jade_event_management_blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">We have over 550 other courses to choose from</a>!</span></u>\n\nNew to distance learning? <a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/how-it-works?utm_source=jade_event_management_blog_post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Find out more about how it works, and download a prospectus</a>.',NULL,NULL,9,'2019-04-25 09:48:59','2019-04-25 09:48:59',1,'https://blog.openstudycollege.com/9005-autosave-v1/',1,1,1,0,0,NULL,NULL),

David is determined to continue his development, meaning he will never stop learning. Here&rsquo;s what David had to say about his distance learning experience with Open Study College&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What&rsquo;s your background in terms of education?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am educated to degree level, graduating in 1991 with an honours degree in Electrical Engineering.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What made you want to study your chosen subject/course?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve had a small creative business for some years and initially wanted to study a course that included a SAGE computerised accounts package. I also wanted to learn double-entry bookkeeping, so I decided to go for the complete package course.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What was your motivation for studying?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My main motivation was mostly for personal achievement following a serious illness. I also partly wanted to study to open up future employment opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why did you choose distance learning over traditional study methods?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no travelling to the local college involved! And it allowed me to study when I best felt like it, meaning I could complete the course at my own pace.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why did you choose to study with Open Study College?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Open Study College was on the accredited list of study providers for the ICB (Institute of Certified Bookkeepers). They offered the best value for a package course, particularly with the additional Diploma in Payroll Management that went with the bookkeeping course.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What have you enjoyed most about your studies?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Learning new skills and seeking to expand my own knowledge and understanding has always been important. The stage when I finally &ldquo;got double-entry bookkeeping&rdquo; was a great feeling of achievement!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What do you plan to do with your course after completing your studies?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have no plans at the moment with regard to bookkeeping and accounts. Although, having completed the courses, there are now other options that may be open to me in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Do you plan to study any further in the future?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have no plans at present, but I don&rsquo;t intend to stop learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Is there anything else you&rsquo;d like to add?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Open Study College&rsquo;s course notes were comprehensive and easy to follow, with plenty of worked examples and &lsquo;test yourself&rsquo; questions to try before attempting the assessments. The tutor system was very efficient and, in the few instances that I needed help with a particular topic, the responses were quick and helpful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out more about our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openstudycollege.com/courses/icb-bookkeeping-payroll-package-course\">ICB Bookkeeping and Payroll&nbsp;</a>course, head over to our website.</p>','ICB Bookkeeping and Payroll course','/storage/images/post_images/David_1559829027.jpg',9,'2019-06-06 13:50:27','2019-06-10 13:04:14',2,NULL,2,1,1,8,NULL,'/storage/images/post_images/David_1559829027.jpg',NULL),
